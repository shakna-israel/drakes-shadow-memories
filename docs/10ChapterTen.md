# Chapter Ten

~~~

By the powers of her enemies,
glory is given unto her.

- Rising, anon.

Suzie opened the door slowly, and saw Quinn standing there, stiff faced and formal.

She smiled warmly and walked in, "Come in."

Quinn closed the door slowly, following her nervously.

Suzie sat down in her chair, another one across the coffee table from her, "Have a seat."

The Director of the NSA looked haggard, worn out, and absolutely exhausted. He sat down, and stared as Nassu appeared with coffee, before disappearing again.

"What is this?"

Suzie shrugged, "Some people refer to it as polite company. I prefer... To think of it as... Making ammends. Or starting to."

Quinn looked at her, "What?"

"I..." She winced and bit her lip, "I've been a bitch. Plain and simple. But..."

Quinn shook his head, "I get it, Drakes. I do. I've seen your file. I've seen what you've lost... And after spending these passed few days with you... I think I can start to actually understand. To have so much intelligence, so much... Genius... And yet, you've still been forced to lose so much..."

She winced, "Yeah."

Quinn shrugged, "Well, the parties involved finally agreed. You're out. They won't come for you. The threat did the trick."

He reached into his suit jacket and pulled out a document, placing it on the coffee table, "This is an agreement. You don't touch us, and we don't touch you."

Suzie tapped the coffee table beside the document and a blue square appeared around it, and she tapped a couple of icons, "This document, in it's entirety, will be sent to various news outlets in case of my demise."

Quinn laughed, looking at her, "Is anything in this house low-tech? A table actually a table?"

Suzie shrugged sheepishly, "I got bored one night. This kept me entertained for a few hours."

"You just built a massive computer in the shape of a table." Quinn shook his head, "You're a hell of a woman, Drakes."

He stood up slowly, "Thanks for the coffee, but I should be going."

Suzie nodded with a smile, "Come around sometime, maybe you can actually drink something."

He smiled, "Maybe I will."

After the front door closed Suzie sat down by the table again, and opened a file.

The document was simple, just a heauristic analysis on behaviour, for a person of interest.

It correlated what she'd been noticing.

Steven Quinn was compromised, he was an agent working for the Homegrown Front.

The last Nassu walked into the underground space and relaxed into a chair, smiling up at her, "Call us, when you need us again."

Suzie smiled, "Of course. But, for now... Fill search seeing electricity belt red is unknown."

The floor closed as they deactivated and she rubbed her face.

Suzie sighed and tapped the wall, a console appearing, which she promptly tapped an eight key combination into. Nearby, drones were taking to the air, ready to protect the house.

Drones may not be as fast or capable as Nassu... But they were far less terrifying.

She was always a last resort.

Suzie smiled as Arlia toddled into the room, "You ready, sweetie?"

Arlia cringed, "The machine looks scary."

She shrugged weakly, "I can't exactly turn it into a soft toy."

Arlia nodded slowly, "I don't like this... I don't like being me. I feel wrong."

"That's what I'm going to try and figure out." Suzie smiled, taking her hand, "This machine lets me see your brain, and I'll be able to see what's different, and maybe, why it is so different."

They went down to a sub-basement, and Arlia crawled up into a white chair, and a small band was slipped around her forehead.

Suzie frowned as she grabbed a nearby tablet computer, "This is going to tingle. Its going to vibrate."

Arlia nodded, fighting back tears.

The kid was certainly brave. She reminded Suzie so much of Ted.

Now she was the one fighting back tears.

The image sprang to life on her tablet, and Suzie swivelled it, concern etching itself into her face. She seperated out a piece of the brain, staring at it.

"Mummy?" Came a terrified voice, and Suzie smiled weakly, "Its okay, Arlia... Just... They did something to you, when you were away. They made you... Smarter?"

Suzie sighed and put the tablet to the side and picked up her daughter, placing aside the scanner, "They changed the way you think, so that you can learn faster. You were always a fast learner... But now... Now they've turned it up to eleven."

"I just wanna be normal!" Arlia wailed, burying her head in Suzie's chest, and she stroked her hair slowly, "Its going to be okay, Arlia. It will be okay."

They kidnapped her daughter.

They tortured her on live TV.

Manipulated the brain tissue with experiments.

They'd been raising Arlia, changing her into a weapon, one that was as dangerous as Drakes herself had become.

But not for her daughter.

This wasn't going to be her life.

Suzie fought back her terror, she had to be a mother.

She pushed aside a door, and lowered Arlia gently to the floor.

The toddler glanced around, a smile slowly appearing, "Mechanics, robotics, synthesisers and printers... You work here?"

Suzie shrugged, "Its my lab... Its... My only distraction from me. The only place I can unleash, and find a challenge. Learn."

Arlia looked over at her, "They gave me one... I played with embedded computers. Not teddy bears."

Suzie nodded, "And you're still learning... So quickly... Until I can figure this out, and work out if its right to even try and reverse what they did to you... This is your playground. We're smart, you and I, and smart is dangerous. I built Nassu, and she saved me, you, and others... But Nassu is dangerous. She can think. She can decide. She could tear down the world around us, and the people out there don't deserve that."

Arlia frowned, "I need to be careful?"

"You need to think first, and act later." Suzie said slowly and smiled tightly, "Don't burn the world, it'll do that to itself in due time... But before then, we can make it better. And that doesn't mean hurting people."

Arlia cocked her head, "You fight."

"Only when I have to." Suzie smiled, "Arlia... All my nerves were burnt out, and my muscles were torn to shreds. I've had more bones broken than I have in my body. The body was ruined, screaming out at me in pain, day after day... So I built myself something new. A better body, inside my own... But that same technology... I could use it to take pain away from the people who suffer from it day in and out. Chronic pain sufferers, those with nerve damage, and those who simply can't repair the muscles in their bodies correctly. I can help them."

She paused and shrugged, "But I haven't. Because the hospitals wouldn't be the only ones with it. The military would take the technology, and make soldiers who don't feel pain, who don't need to train as hard, and can fight harder and longer. They'd make monsters."

Arlia smiled, "And you fight the monsters."

Suzie felt her mouth slip upwards on one side, "Yeah."

The little girl smiled at her, her eyes full of knowledge no little girl should have, "I understand, mum."

She waddled over and grabbed a nearby tool, "You need to hunt the monsters... And in the meantime... I've got an idea about a ball that can almost float. Like a helium balloon, but more fun."

---

Suzie's finger hovered over the send button.

It was an email, to someone she was incredibly uncertain about.

How much did she tell him?

Well... The email spelled it all out.

The way Arlia's brain had been modified, why they had done it, and that it showed the hallmarks of a professor the NSA had recently identified as a Homegrown Front member.

She hit send.

No point thinking about it, just get it over and done with.

She sighed and leaned forward, looking at the coffee table carefully.

Live feeds from her lab, where Arlia was giggling and bouncing around in the air, the drones overhead, and her front door were all on display.

She clenched her fists.

She wasn't in control, someone was trying to manipulate her again, and this time... She didn't know who they were or what they wanted.

This was personal.

A vendetta.

She had been targetted for destruction, by any means possible.

Contingency after contingency had been planned.

She was surrounded by the fingerprints of the man who wanted her dead - if it was a man. She couldn't piece together the profile.

All she knew, was that whoever it was, had gone to incredible lengths to incapacitate her.

They had attempted to use her to build a weapon - as a ruse to frame her.

Then they had removed her family from her, so that she would be distracted by grief.

Then they had been experimenting on Arlia, so that they could turn her into Suzie's assassin one day.

If that failed, they'd ensured that Suzie would be too preoccupied saving her daughter to come hunting them down.

This was a kind of anger that she had never felt.

Cool, calm and collected.

Thoughtful.

She was up against person or persons unknown, and they were light years ahead of her in thinking.

It was terrifying.

The door bell chimed.

Fourteen minutes and forty three seconds since she'd sent the email.

Suzie walked over and opened the door, smiling as she saw Quinn standing there.

The Director of the NSA shrugged, "How are you holding up?"

Suzie rolled her eyes and let him in, "I'm me. I'm planning how to find the people responsible. Punishing them is going to be your job, and I can help."

Quinn glanced at her, "Really? I get the vengeance bit... But exactly how can you help track anyone down? That hospital has been nothing but dead ends."

Suzie walked over to a bench and made two coffees, handing one to Quinn and sipping.

"I can help, because I know what to look for."

He rolled his eyes and sipped, "And what exactly is that?"

"You." Suzie said as the director tumbled backwards, she caught his mug in midair, making sure it didn't spill scalding fluid over her captive and placed it aside.

She sighed and threw the man over her shoulder and walked downstairs, strapping him into the white chair.

The scanner went around his head, and she picked up the tablet and stepped back, looking at him as Quinn blinked furiously.

"Wha... Suzie? What...?" He struggled with his bonds for a moment before it sank in, "Suzie... What are you doing?"

She smiled tightly, looking at his brain carefully, "Huh... Your learning ability has been accelerated... Not nearly to the same extent as my daughter, but they had years with her."

"You're not making any sense, Drakes." He growled, and Suzie raised an eyebrow, "You called me Suzie upstairs. You don't normally do that."

His fists tensed, "Do you know how much trouble you're going to be in, trapping me here? I got you out of hell, and its going to pour down on your head!"

"What do you know about the Homegrown Front?" Suzie asked seriously, looking at the scan, and Quinn rolled his eyes, "Next to nothing!"

Suzie looked up at him, glaring, "Don't lie to me. I'm looking at a live feed of your brain."

She glanced back down at the tablet, "Tell me about Geoffrey Whitlam."

"He's nobody. Never was anybody."

Suzie frowned, expanding a section of data on brain waves, "Interesting... You actually believe that... But you have a ton of memories associated with the name."

Quinn glared, "What are you getting at Drakes? Why are you doing this?"

"You've been brainwashed by the Homegrown Front, Quinn." She shrugged, "I found the same evidents of experiments in my daughter. You are beyond trusting."

Suzie grabbed a nearby microcontroller and placed it under a microscope, soldering on it, "I think I have a way that could help us both."

"You're insane!" He yelled, his voice changing pitch, and Suzie smiled as she finished the chip and turned around, attaching it the end of a hyperdermic needle.

"Sorry, Quinn. You don't get out of this that way."

She walked behind him and injected it at the base of his skull, and glanced at her tablet, smiling as she saw the chip attach.

It was transmitting data.

Then the screen went red, and Quinn spasmed.

She ran over to her tablet and pulled up his vitals, and spotted his heart. "Shit!"

Suzie sent a command to overclock to the chip she'd just inserted, downloading as much data from his brain as she could, and then grabbed two probes from nearby.

She waited as long as she could - about four point six seconds, and then tried to restart his heart.

It took three shocks before he coughed, coming back to the world of the living.

Suzie sighed heavily, glancing at the data on her tablet - her chip was still running, but next to burn out.

It could only do one function now, the primary one.

Overriding the chemical changes that had taken root in Quin's brain.

No more brainwashing.

But... No more buried data.

She walked upstairs with the tablet, leaving Quinn tied up.

She still had little idea of what they had done to him.

She extrapolated the data, using a guessing framework to hypothesize what kind of data each fragment was, and where it had come from.

She was interested in the memories, and what the relationships were between them.

She found one piece of data that was relatively intact.

A memory of language, repeated throughout the data she'd managed to snag.

An audible phrase.

She ran a filter to piece together the scattered data that was closely related, assembling an audible sound, and translating it so she could reproduce it.

"T e str ng l ve, wh st t e w k d."

Suzie didn't need a algorythm to tell her what the phrase was, and she whispered it aloud, wondering how it fit it with the bigger picture, "The strong live whilst the weak die."

---

Suzie crouched behind Arlia with the needle, and her daughter winced, "Didn't this give the other man a heart attack?"

She smiled softly, "I just slapped that solution together. For you, I've worked long and hard... Now... Do you want to be normal? Really?"

Arlia nodded her head, "I want to forget. I want... To be a toddler. I want to laugh and cry and get frustrated that people don't understand me."

Suzie inserted the needle careful and placed the chip.

Arlia gasped, and then tumbled forward, losing her balance.

She hit the ground and burst into tears, crying out as tears poured down her face, and Suzie picked her up gently, "Its okay, Arlia. Mummy's here."

She rocked the girl back and forth, fighting back tears.

She hoped she'd made the right choice for her daughter.
