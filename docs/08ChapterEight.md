# Chapter Eight

~~~

How many must die,
how many must fall,
till her will is broken?

Her daughter,
taken before her first steps,
hidden from the world by a will unbending.

- Rising, anon.

"Andrew McIntyre." 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "Bullshit, Styles." 

"Suzie, I was wondering when you would get around to calling me." 

She ground her teeth together, "I was a bit busy." 

"Breaking out of an ASIO compound, aided by your formidable companion, Nassu. I'm sure the caf√© is safe, for now." 

His arrogance had always got to her, and it did now, more than ever. 

"Tell me about Arlia." 

Styles sighed heavily, "I was a cop, not a monster. I'd give her to you if I could, but me and mine can't go up against the people who own that hospital." 

Suzie clenched her fists, her knuckles going white around the phone, "Explain." 

"Calm down, Suzie. I'm on your side. Or I try to be... I need to explain a few things... Josiah McIntyre has never been a safe man to be around, and he has always been rather intelligent, but he was bankrolled into using your QNN to stage an attack." Styles voice came across, compassionate and strong, trying to explain things that he knew, that she did not. 

Suzie winced, "Sounds like it." 

"That's not all. The same people who funded McIntyre, also spent a great deal of money on an ASIO agent that they captured, brainwashing him." 

Suzie swallowed, "John O'Connor." 

"Yes." Styles sighed heavily, "These same people targetted you and your family, causing you to do something that you would never have done otherwise." 

She remembered the weapon, the people she had killed. 

"Arlia?" 

"A failsafe, against you." Styles said, and she could almost imagine the man shrugging, "I'm trying to stop them, Suzie. I don't have a lot of resources on hand, but the UHF is an invaluable one... They don't move quickly, the group is always on the edge of splintering apart into factions... But they have been useful." 

Suzie shook her head, "You're crazy Styles. The UHF is volatile enough without you trying to turn them into a police taskforce." 

"Then come see them for yourself, Suzie." 

She paused and then smiled, "Sure."

"Insane. Utterly insane."

Suzie glared at Quinn, "What, a hacker group having a meetup in Melbourne?"

"Two intelligence agents walking into a terrorist camp. We're supposed to be intelligent." Quinn said harshly, but she just shrugged, "You want answers, don't you?"

The destination was an apartment block, in the heart of suburbia.

Suzie opened the door slowly with a creak, feeling Quinn at her back as she entered. Their footfalls echo on the tiles as they move forward, and she sighs as she hears the movement behind her, feeling the press of steel.

She spun, her hand easily wrenching the weapon free, and her forehead stunning the man before her knee landed in his family jewels.

A quick punch on his way down knocked him out.

Another man beside her hit the ground at the same time, and Suzie smiled at Quinn.

They made a good team.

"Still convinced we're welcome guests?"

She shrugged, "Doesn't much matter if we are, does it?"

"I'm not a field agent. I'm the damn director. We should have backup."

His argument had merit to it, but they were close, and she wasn't about to lost this lead. Not this time.

Suzie walked over to the stairs, walking around and around as she slowly rose, trying to fight the anxiety at being so exposed in a place that was clearly enemy territory.

She paused at the fourth floor, wincing as she saw the guard protecting the outside of the apartment, but rather than reaching for his gun, he rolled his eyes and opened the door.

Suzie walked passed calmly, waiting for an attack that never came.

Quinn was right behind her.

The door closed slowly.

It was not what she expected.

No nest of professional soldiers aiming guns at them cautiously.

No cigars and men trying to impress beyond their intelligence.

It was a hub of computers and half-built small flying drones. TVs dotted the walls, code rolling on some, news on others. The chatter of nerds at work, discussing the fastest methods for compiling and execution, whether to use a for loop or a while loop, what are the best ways to store data effectively, or securely.

It felt like a night at home with herself.

Around the programmers walked men who were clearly not - organisers and managers, directing efforts, gathering progress reports and mostly keeping to themselves.

Suzie's eyes were drawn to the one man not moving, a man sitting in a corner, calmly watching a series of video feeds, and writing notes.

She moved quickly, barely thinking, and the burnt-out husk of a man who had once saved her life was staring down the barrel of a handgun.

The entire left side of his face was missing, replaced by a flexible plastic, the eyes by a high-quality camera. An attempt at repairing the damage that had been done.

She could see the nerve reconstruction, the bone replacements, the spinal problem that still plagued the man.

But all she wanted to do was shoot.

"... Drakes." Came the voice of reason, the only man still fighting to keep her alive.

She holstered it slowly, breathing heavily, and glared at Quinn who shrugged, "Let's at least hear the man out."

Styles shrugged, painfully, and gestured to two nearby chairs.

Quinn relaxed into it.

Suzie barely sat, still itching to tear the man to pieces.

Where the hell had he been? Why was he dragging her into this shitstorm? Didn't he understand the price she had already paid?

"There's... Not a lot to tell. I faked my death, so I could get away. I knew, straightaway, that ending McIntyre was not the last thing that you would do, Suzie. I knew the intelligence community were going to circle you like vultures, and anyone remotely connected to you would end up trapped, and dead. So I tried to hide." He paused, rubbing the non-existent part of his face, and then continued, "An anonymous group hunted me down. It took them time, and I kept ahead for a good while... But they found me. Imprisoned me. They copied my fingerprints and eyes and broke into secure datastores utilises by our good friends in the Australian intelligence community."

Since when had Styles had anything to do with ASIO?

He was a cop.

Suzie knew there was more to the man, but something was wrong there.

"I eventually escaped, and dug into the group. They were not a hacker coalition. They were terrorists, plain and simple. But they were... Interesting. They expanded on the concept of Al-Qaeda, of sharing workers and militants between cells with similar beliefs. Except, this group didn't care about belief. They... Crowdfunded each other. They funded themselves by jobs, stocks... As well as some criminal activities. They were an expert trading community, devoted to... Destruction for results." Styles paused, his fists clenching.

Evidently the nerve restructing hadn't worked entirely. The man's brain was still attempting to scream his pain to him, though it had long since healed, or been replaced.

"Has anyone connected to this group ever been ID'd?" Suzie asked, her scepticism dripping like poison from her tones, and Styles nodded carefully, "Andrew Martin, Elizabeth Gruer, Eric Tadder, Geoffrey Whitlam... A few others."

Suzie winced.

Geoffrey Whitlam had kidnapped her husband, and tortured her daughter.

"... Seriously?" Quinn scoffed, "Then why don't I know who you're talking about?"

Styles rolled his eyes, "PRISM can't see everything Director, actually... Have you ever found a terrorist by compromising everyone's rights? Intel comes from monitoring real people, who live and fight. Not by watching how many times someone buys a cup of coffee."

"... So you shut down the internet so you could grab a freeze frame." Suzie stated blandly, pointing out the hypocricy.

Styles smiled softly, "We took a snapshot of the last sections of the Dark Net to fold. They were reinforced, areas nobody can patrol unless they already know where they are. But, without the noise of network traffic in the world, we can see them."

He flicked through his notepad, "From this information, we've pinpointed twenty six agents that work for the group that once kidnapped me."

Quinn shook his head, "You need to give us more than that, like... What do they even call themselves?"

"They call themselves the Homegrown Front." 

Quinn's face hardened to stone, and he clenched his fists, "The NSA blew them out of the water in the 80s."

Suzie sighed, "Well, they're back." 

Styles looked at her directly, his new eye focusing carefully, probably watching for signs of emotion, "Suzie... Can you help us locate, and capture, the memebrs of the Homegrown Front?"

Suzie winced, thinking.

There was so much at stake, and she had already lost so much.

Her life was littered with the dead.

More people kept dying because of her: Greg Walsh, Josiah McInytre.

"No." She stated, her belief in the decision hardening as she voiced it, "I'm done, Styles. I just want a normal life. I just want to be free... Of all of this."

The disappointment slammed into the man, and Styles looked at her, annoyance clear, "You aren't the woman I remember."

Suzie shrugged, "I've given enough. I gave my mind, and body, and lost my family and nearly my life. No more." 

The man sneered at her, curling the fake side of his face in an odd way, "Then I guess you'll never get Arlia back." 

Suzie snapped to her feet, gun flying into her hand, and the managers nearby went down, holes in their heads, and then it swung back and fired twice.

Each bullet precisely aimed, tearing through the tendons and nerve clusters in Style's knees.

He howled in agony, and she glared at him, and yelled at the top of her voice, "Where is my daughter?"
