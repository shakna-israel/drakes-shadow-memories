# Chapter Eight

"Andrew McIntyre." 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "Bullshit, Styles." 

"Suzie, I was wondering when you would get around to calling me." 

She ground her teeth together, "I was a bit busy." 

"Breaking out of an ASIO compound, aided by your formidable companion, Nassu. I'm sure the caf√© is safe, for now." 

His arrogance had always got to her, and it did now, more than ever. 

"Tell me about Arlia." 

Styles sighed heavily, "I was a cop, not a monster. I'd give her to you if I could, but me and mine can't go up against the people who own that hospital." 

Suzie clenched her fists, her knuckles going white around the phone, "Explain." 

"Calm down, Suzie. I'm on your side. Or I try to be... I need to explain a few things... Josiah McIntyre has never been a safe man to be around, and he has always been rather intelligent, but he was bankrolled into using your QNN to stage an attack." Styles voice came across, compassionate and strong, trying to explain things that he knew, that she did not. 

Suzie winced, "Sounds like it." 

"That's not all. The same people who funded McIntyre, also spent a great deal of money on an ASIO agent that they captured, brainwashing him." 

Suzie swallowed, "John O'Connor." 

"Yes." Styles sighed heavily, "These same people targetted you and your family, causing you to do something that you would never have done otherwise." 

She remembered the weapon, the people she had killed. 

"Arlia?" 

"A failsafe, against you." Styles said, and she could almost imagine the man shrugging, "I'm trying to stop them, Suzie. I don't have a lot of resources on hand, but the UHF is an invaluable one... They don't move quickly, the group is always on the edge of splintering apart into factions... But they have been useful." 

Suzie shook her head, "You're crazy Styles. The UHF is volatile enough without you trying to turn them into a police taskforce." 

"Then come see them for yourself, Suzie." 

She paused and then smiled, "Sure."

Quinn complains that Suzie is insane as they enter the apartment block. 

A guard places guns at the back of their heads, and Styles and Suzie disable the man and take the guns in sync. 

She walks up the stairs, and a man opens the door and casually waves them in. 

The two walk in and find a tech hub, computers and tvs everywhere, programmers and managers walking around, issuing orders, and hacking. 

Styles is by himself, nearby, and heavily disfigured. 

Suzie barely resists shooting him on the spot. 

The man invites them both to sit down, and explains how he faked his death to hide, but an anonymous group began hunting him down. They eventually caught him, copied his eyes and fingerprints into a computer system and used it to break into ASIO. 

He escaped and found the group was a coalition crowdfunding terrorists, and also allowing for trading of experts, intelligence, and goals. They made use of normal jobs, stocks, as well as money laundering operations. They were united not by belief, but by practicality. However, they still utilised the splinter cell model. 

Suzie asks if any individuals within this group had been id'd, and Styles rattles of a list of names, Suzie recognizing several, including the man who kidnapped her daughter. 

Quinn is skeptical, the NSA not knowing about the group. 

Styles laughs at him, saying that PRISM can only see what it gets told. Real Intel comes from monitoring people, not the world. (PRISM being a failure). 

Suzie asks how the analysis of the net was different, and Styles smiled, the snapshot they took was of the last sections of the Dark Net that collapsed, reinforced areas that weren't listed. 

They'd id'd twenty six agents so far. 

Quinn asked what the.group were calling themselves, still skeptical. 

Styles says, "They call themselves the Homegrown Front." 

Quinn goes deadly serious, saying NSA destroyed the group in the 80s. 

Suzie sighs, "Well, they're back." 

Styles asks Suzie if she can help locate and capture the group. 

Suzie considers it, and then refuses, stating that she just wants a normal life, and to be free of everything. 

Styles is slightly annoyed, and intensely disappointed, "You aren't the woman I remember." 

Suzie shrugged, "I've given enough. I gave my mind, and body, and lost my family and nearly my life. No more." 

Styles is aggravated, and says, "Then I guess you'll never get Arlia back." 

Suzie kills half a dozen people in the room and shoots Styles in both legs, yells, "Where is my daughter?"
