# Chapter Eight

Magnetic clamps, another interrogation room. 

Once again, she was on the wrong side of it. 

The agent glared at her, "Come now, Drakes. You must have worked out what this is all about, by now." 

Suzie sighed heavily, "You let me go, or you will die. I swear it." 

The agent blinked, "Now, now, no need to get violent. That's my job, when you don't tell me what I want to know." 

Her jaw spasmed as her teeth clenched together, "I will destroy you. And everyone in this building. Just leave me alone." 

The man sighed heavily and pulled a small stick from his belt and touched the table with it lightly, and the electrical arc shot through her. 

She screamed in agony, and then was drowned out as a siren went off, and a red light filled the room. 

A disembodied voice spoke as the agent backed up in surprise, "Unknown pathogen detected. Quarantine procedures in effect." 

He glared at her, "What the hell did you do?" 

Suzie smiled weakly, looking up at him, "Nothing. I'm tied to a damn desk." 

The nearby metal door that had locked shut suddenly turned into a pool of molten metal on the floor, and the agent stared at the figure in utter confusion. 

Suzie couldn't help but grin, "Now, my stunt double on the other hand... She has a will of her own." 

*** 

Suzie rubbed her wrists as they walked quickly down the hallway, glancing at her savior she frowned, "I never did quite get the fluidity of movement right for you, did I?" 

The robot responded without emotion, mimicking her voice, "I was designed to learn, I can learn to walk in my own time." 

Suzie grinned, "Yep... So where we headed, Nassu?" 

"Director Quinn was taken in for questioning. I believe he will have received the same primitive treatment as you." 

It was always disturbing to hear her own voice, devoid of emotion, but it was all she had been able to work with. 

Suzie frowned, "Where's Quinn being held?" 

Nassu gestured to a nearby door, where two frightened guards were standing. 

They went to fire, but Nassu was already on them, bent gun barrels and broken necks. 

Suzie took a spray can from Nassu's backpack and sprayed the edges of the door, and as they began to melt kicked it down. 

She glanced at the ASIO agent and shook her head, "Son, just don't." 

The man backed away and Suzie smiled at Quinn, "You up for a run?" 

He blinked, looking from her to her guard, "And this is?" 

"Quinn, meet Nassu. Nassu, Quinn." She said with a smile, and the robot waved, "Good evening, Director Quinn." 

Suzie turned the clamps off and Quinn stood up slowly, "A... Robot?" 

Nassu turned to him, "Indeed, Director. Now, may I suggest that we make haste? ASIO may have been simple to infiltrate, but exfiltration is far more difficult." 

As they sprinted down the hallways, avoiding and incapacitating threats, Suzie's mind was at work. 

The United Humanitarian Front. 

They knew something about her, about what had happened to Arlia. 

The aggressiveness and protectiveness that they had shown her was familiar, unrestrained and highly perceptive. 

Styles. 

He was in charge, he was the one who took an innocent group and had turned them into a weapon. 

He knew her. 

He knew something about Arlia. 

He had the capabilities to disable worldwide communications. 

And she had not a clue what he wanted. 

*** 

The wind whipped through her hair as she sat staring out the window as the jeep bumped along the road towards a small town. 

Nassu spoke mechanically from the driver's seat, "This is the nearest populace to the location where ASIO decided to hold you. It is not a particular safe location, if they are hunting for us, but it will allow us to plan the next move." 

Quinn winced, "She is totally freaky, Drakes. Seriously. The voice?" 

Suzie smiled sadly, pulling inside the car, "I know, I just didn't have a lot to work with. My vocal cords, or another stupid computer-generated voice. Mine sounds better." 

"I'm in a car with two Susan Drakes. I'm a dead man." Quinn muttered. 

She couldn't blame him for that one. 

The jeep slowed as it entered the town, "Suzie?" 

She glanced at Nassu and smiled, she had spent a good deal of time ensuring the robot was something more, and just maybe, she had succeeded. "A café. I want a network." 

Nassu turned the vehicle, "There is one nearby, that makes use of a free WiFi hotspot to draw customers. They are located near an NBN fibre optic line, though not connected, as limitations are myriad." 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "The network was an abysmal failure, as far as projects go. But, its definitely faster than WiFi." 

They pulled up and jumped out, she glanced at Nassu, "Go connect the NBN in, would you?" 

She grabbed a tablet from the car and walked into the café, followed by Quinn, and smiled at the waitress, "Table for two?" 

The woman waved, "Any table, love. Would you like to start with some Devinshire Tea?" 

Suzie shrugged, "Sounds great." 

She sat down and Quinn winced, "I'm not sure we have the time, or the cash." 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "This tablet has NFC. Its connected in to the various credit card tap-to-pay technologies. We're fine." 

"Seized accounts?" 

Suzie laughed, "Which ones? I was on the run, remember?" 

He shrugged and frowned, "As for time?" 

Suzie shushed him, tapping away, "Nassu's finished... Here we go..." 

She paused and turned the tablet around, "This is the footage from the prison, when they got the drop on us. Watch this." 

Quinn winced as they both passed out, the one enemy taken out by his taser, and then more guards entered the room. 

Six professionals, accompanied by one man, clearly the one they reported to. He went through and checked to see if McIntyre was dead, and then walked passed them, signaling for the others to follow. 

Suzie paused the video and zoomed, "Tell me who this looks like." 

Quinn nodded hesitantly, "It does look like Styles." 

She spun the tablet back around, and began tapping away, "Now then, it’s a long shot, but he might have had his phone on him then... There's six hundred active phones in the area, at that time... Two hundred belong to people who are registered to vote in this town... Three hundred and fifty or so belong to the ASIO station... Here we go, he's probably one of these six." 

Quinn glanced at her, "Anyone tell you that you're scary, Drakes?" 

She smiled sweetly at him, "Only if I let them." 

She frowned, "Well, from the few pieces of location data from those phones, I think I'll just call this one." 
Quinn cocked an eyebrow, "Tablet and phone? Where did you manage to pick those up?" 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "Nassu came and got us. She didn't come unprepared."
