# Chapter Three

Suzie grinned in her chair as the computer finished logging in, and the shell sat there, a small cursor blinking. 

She had her own office space, within the NSA base of operations, and it overlooked the city. It was beautiful. 

She smiled and began to create a recursive search. 

"McIntyre Industries… Firewalls, bah… Ooh, are you going to try and redirect me? Hmm… That router looks tasty… And… I'm in." She smiled as she scanned the repositories in front of her, private programming projects created by McIntyre Industries, most of them classified government projects. 

She frowned as her search began returning names and results, "Damn… I wasn't specific enough…" 

Suzie paused as her computer screen seemed to freeze up, and she hit a couple of keys, nothing. 

"God damn it… Please tell me this thing didn't freeze." 

Then a deep male voice spoke, coming from the speakers, "Don't fly too close to the sun, little Icarus, your wings might melt." 

Suzie slammed the lid and scooted backwards, "Mother-fucking piece of shit!" 

She stared as the computer powered down and swallowed nervously, "How in the hell did you get past my security?" 

*** 

Quinn waved a hand, "The other techs are analysing the laptop. Any idea how he did it?" 

Suzie shook her head, "None. I don't have any idea how he broke in… Not that fast. I had some serious security set up on that thing… Any luck with ASIO?" 

Quinn sighed heavily, tousling his greying hair, "Nup. They're stalling… But they might give us something, if you give them something." 

Suzie smiled slowly, "He knows we're on to him. That much is clear. I probably tripped a file at McIntyre he had under watch, so he's scared. He knows McIntyre can identify him… So he'll get him killed. Have him assassinated… And well, with a guy that can bring down the internet? Most banks use cloud frontends to let clients exchange money between accounts… But that'll be enough that he will find a way in. This guy has the world's cash at his disposal." 

Quinn swallowed, "Is any computer system safe? From this hacker, I mean. Few people can do what he has." 

Suzie shrugged, "I know you want my opinion… But… I've never seen someone who can do what this guy can. That being said, isolated systems, systems not connected to the internet at all, they're probably safe. But… Most banks won't shut down. Too many customer complaints. People want their money." 

Quinn spun to the room, "Isolate our systems. Time to cut the cord, people!" 

He turned back and smiled, and pulled up his phone and dialled, and put it on speaker, sitting the phone between him and Suzie. 

An infuriated man answered the phone, "You aren't getting a damn thing, Quinn! This is our country, not yours. We won't help you, until you hand Drakes back over to us." 

Suzie laughed, "Seriously, that's your concern? McIntyre is going to die." 

"There's no record of where he is, not on any computer." The man scoffed, "He's safe." 

Suzie frowned, "Really? Your system is already compromised. To make the hard copy to say where McIntyre is being held, someone printed it. They typed it up on a computer first… And didn't delete the file correctly. The hacker has recovered that file." 

The man swore violently and hung up. 

Quinn stared at her, and she shrugged, "Bluffing. That's how I'd do it." 

*** 

Suzie shot to the floor as the glass shattered, dragging Quinn down with her. 

Nearby an agent's head jerked and they collapsed to the floor, blood pouring from the hole in their forehead. 

Quinn held her down, and glanced around, "Across from us. Damn. Get to the elevator, and out." 

He glanced over, "Walsh! Get her out of here! She's all we've got!" 

Suzie ran and dove for cover, wincing as she felt a piece of the desk she was leaning against disappear. 

The agent landed next to her, breathing hard, and Suzie smiled, glancing at the elevator, and grabbed a stapler from the desk and tossed it, hard. 

The elevator doors swung open, "Now!" 

Walsh dove after her and they hit the ground, Suzie kicking the shut door button and slamming herself up against the wall, a hole appearing nearby in the floor. 

The elevator beeped and they began to descend. 

She breathed out slowly and stood up, glancing at the nervous agent leaning against the opposite wall, "Some day, huh?" 

He looked at her as if she was insane, "What?" 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "Dude, you've got to relax… Why do you work with the NSA?" 

He smiled tightly, "Uh… I was picked up for an interview… I hacked a couple of websites, got caught… They thought I might have some talent, so they set up an internship." 

"Sweet." She smiled, "Better than me. I had to get on the news before ASIO noticed. I built myself a robot arm. My right arm didn't use to work, like, at all." 

Walsh frowned, "Really? How?" 

"I was in a car accident. Managed to wipe out all the nerves with a nasty break. The break healed… The arm didn't. So I built a skeleton around it, and I got famous." 

He nodded, "Yeah… I remember hearing about that… You used a Quantum Neuron Network to make it work, didn't you?" 

Suzie shrugged, "I did, but ended up getting rid of it. Too scary." 

Walsh smiled, "Wow. Usually I just sort of filter through files. I use this simple crawler bot I made." 

"You made a crawler?" Suzie frowned, "How?" 

He smiled, embarrassed, "I kind of used this open source AI, that got shut down. I altered it, stripped it down, got rid of a lot of irrelevant code, now it can try and identify data for me." 

Suzie laughed, "Broly Core, right?" 

He smiled, "Yeah, you know the project?" 

"I wrote it." She said with a grin and he stared, "Wow." 

The elevator door pinged, and Suzie snapped around, ready to fight, and then she felt the blood spatter her face. 

"Fuck!" She said, diving forward, rolling behind a car as a series of shots followed her. 

She glanced back at the elevator, her gut sinking as she saw Walsh lying on the ground. 

Suzie tensed her fists. 

Not again. 

She grabbed the roof of the car and flipped over it, arcing in the air, spotting the gunner and landing on her wrists, tossing herself forwards into a dive, her legs wrapping around his throat. 

She landed, struggling as he fought her, and then his arm popped with a crunching sound. 

He screamed and she tossed the gun aside, and began walking back to the elevator, dragging the man by his broken arm as he screamed. 

She tossed him in and closed the elevator doors, using the emergency pad to lock them shut. 

She glared at the man lying against the wall, holding his arm limply, "Try and fight, and I'll break more bones… But you're not going to die… Not without a lot of pain." 

He smiled weakly, "I not run." 

Drakes picked up Walsh's earpiece, "This is Drakes. One of ours down, one of theirs in captivity." 

"This is Quinn… All clear."
