# Chapter Nine

~~~

Like Odin before her,
great sacrifice must be made,
for the sake of the world,
for the hope that may come.

- Rising, anon.

"What the fuck is wrong with you?" Styles cried, tears pouring down his face as he held his legs, agony ripping through his entire burned out body.

Suzie just stood there, watching him, and he understood.

This was a woman with nothing left to lose.

She'd already lost her entire family, and he'd just teased her.

Reminded him of the story about a tiger and her cub.

And this time, he was in the way.

"We used the callsign, 'Where is Arlia?', to try and get your attention." Styles winced, and she glared at him, finger itching on the trigger, "You have it now."

"We don't know where she is." Styles said quickly, swallowing, "She's alive, and in captivity. She's being held by the Homegrown Front."

A bullet tore through his shoulder, and Suzie holstered her gun as he screamed again, clutching at his new wound, precisly aimed to tear through one of the most painful nerve clusters in the human body.

"Show me what you have."

He glared up at her, "Unless you help us, you will never see Arlia again."

Quinn moved to stop her, knowing what was about to happen, but his reaction was too slow.

Suzie's gun came out again, and Styles collapsed backwards into his seat, his brains sprayed across the back wall.

Suzie sat in a swivel chair idly, as the NSA agents collected the equipment around them, and Quinn stood over her, ranting.

Did the man have an emotion other than anger?

"- just killed him! He was our best fucking lead, Drakes! Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you think you're God? That you can just kill whoever the fuck you feel like? Things are bigger than just you or I, here!" Quinn paused for breath, his face an unattractive tinge of red.

Suzie paused, looked up at him and sighed.

She stood up and pushed passed him, causing Quinn to burst into another tirade, freezing mid sentence as he saw her crouch over Style's body.

She traced the edge of his face, where the repairs had been done, and then pulled out a knife.

"What the fuck, Drakes!?" Quinn screamed from behind her, but she ignored him.

She was good at ignoring people who yelled.

Her mother had been far too good at it.

The plastic lifted away easily, and she tore the few tendrils of skin away, revealing a USB drive nestled amongst the bloody gore.

She picked it up and walked over, pushing it into Quinn's chest, "of this is my problem. If ASIO come for me again... I don't care if I kill them. If they assassinate me, so be it. I simply don't give a shit."

Quinn signaled to two agents, "Susan Drakes, I placing you under arrest."

As the agents hands reached for her, electricity arced out and blew them both off their feet. She glared back at Quinn and shook her head, then turned and left the apartment building.

Nassu paused as Suzie emerged, "Are you okay, Suzie?"
