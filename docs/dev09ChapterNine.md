# Chapter Nine

~~~

Like Odin before her,
great sacrifice must be made,
for the sake of the world,
for the hope that may come.

- Rising, anon.

"What the fuck is wrong with you?" Styles cried, tears pouring down his face as he held his legs, agony ripping through his entire burned out body.

Suzie just stood there, watching him, and he understood.

This was a woman with nothing left to lose.

She'd already lost her entire family, and he'd just teased her.

Reminded him of the story about a tiger and her cub.

And this time, he was in the way.

"We used the callsign, 'Where is Arlia?', to try and get your attention." Styles winced, and she glared at him, finger itching on the trigger, "You have it now."

"We don't know where she is." Styles said quickly, swallowing, "She's alive, and in captivity. She's being held by the Homegrown Front."

A bullet tore through his shoulder, and Suzie holstered her gun as he screamed again, clutching at his new wound, precisly aimed to tear through one of the most painful nerve clusters in the human body.

"Show me what you have."

He glared up at her, "Unless you help us, you will never see Arlia again."

Quinn moved to stop her, knowing what was about to happen, but his reaction was too slow.

Suzie's gun came out again, and Styles collapsed backwards into his seat, his brains sprayed across the back wall.

Suzie sat in a swivel chair idly, as the NSA agents collected the equipment around them, and Quinn stood over her, ranting.

Did the man have an emotion other than anger?

"- just killed him! He was our best fucking lead, Drakes! Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you think you're God? That you can just kill whoever the fuck you feel like? Things are bigger than just you or I, here!" Quinn paused for breath, his face an unattractive tinge of red.

Suzie paused, looked up at him and sighed.

She stood up and pushed passed him, causing Quinn to burst into another tirade, freezing mid sentence as he saw her crouch over Style's body.

She traced the edge of his face, where the repairs had been done, and then pulled out a knife.

"What the fuck, Drakes!?" Quinn screamed from behind her, but she ignored him.

She was good at ignoring people who yelled.

Her mother had been far too good at it.

The plastic lifted away easily, and she tore the few tendrils of skin away, revealing a USB drive nestled amongst the bloody gore.

She picked it up and walked over, pushing it into Quinn's chest, "of this is my problem. If ASIO come for me again... I don't care if I kill them. If they assassinate me, so be it. I simply don't give a shit."

Quinn signaled to two agents, "Susan Drakes, I placing you under arrest."

As the agents hands reached for her, electricity arced out and blew them both off their feet. She glared back at Quinn and shook her head, then turned and left the apartment building.

Nassu paused as Suzie emerged, "Are you okay, Suzie?"

She shook her head, "Not really. What have you learned? I trust you infiltrated their crappy little network?"

"I have, and followed the leads they did not deem worthy of follow-up. I have located Arlia." Nassu said, the last sentence taking on a little more animation.

Suzie cocked an eyebrow, "... And? Where the fuck is my daughter?"

Nassu nodded, "Sorry, Suzie. Arlia is being held in a private hospital, heavily fortified. By my estimation, it would take no less than fourteen well-trained operatives to infiltrate and exfiltrate the compound."

Suzie shrugged and stepped over to the car, opening the door, "Then let's go home."

---

Suzie paused as the car stopped outside her home.

Two agents were posted by her doorway, ASIO.

Four others were waiting for her to make her move.

Two in the car by the street, with the lights out, two more either side of the house.

She frowned, "Wait till I've dealt with them, then follow."

She got out of the car and walked towards the doorway, "You got a problem with a phone call, guy?"

The agent stepped forward, one hand going for his holster, "Ma'am, we are here to talk to you."

"Not interested." Suzie growled, and she moved, feeling machinery inside her activating, and she crossed the ground faster than the man could blink, taking his gun from his holster and smashing it into his face, breaking his jaw and nose.

He collapsed backwards onto the ground.

She heard the car door as the two from the building's shadows began to move, and she tossed the gun as hard as she could, shattering one attacker's leg.

The one directly in front of her found his fist caught, and then she squeezed, shattering it.

She headbutted him as he went down in shock, and grabbed the next, yanking his arm aside as he fired a shot directly into a tree.

She twisted his arm at an impossible angle, causing him to drop the gun as she broke his elbow. Then she picked him up and spun, throwing him into one of the agents coming from the street.

She jumped and bounced off of the moving target, landing behind both agents from the car.

A quick electrical jolt to the back of one's neck caused him to go down, the next managed to fire his gun directly into his own foot before she dislocated his jaw with a punch.

She ignored their groans as she waved to Nassu and they entered her home.

She paused beside the chair she had so often fallen asleep in, and smiled grimly, "Upper amount connected settlers case minute saddle ocean amount same art each."

Half the floor shifted, sliding aside into an underground compartment, revealing two dozen individuals, lying in cradles, their eyes closed, their chests unbreathing.

Nassu looked at her carefully, "Are you sure, Suzie?"

She smiled, "Yep... Design suggest sum double dangerous remain article rule paragraph lying enter state settlers lay pen terrible."

The individuals yawned, as if waking up and stood up slowly.

Twenty four like Nassu.

Her own army.

---

Suzie dropped silently in the night, the drone leaving her behind and moving off back to where it had come.

She landed with a jolt on the helicopter pad of the hospital.

She heard a dozen machine guns cock, and stared at them, smiling grimly.

"Back off, and go back where you came." One of the guards growled angrily, revealing a rich Italian background, "Stay, and die."

Suzie laughed and stood up and shrugged, "Not an option, boys."

Then they all dropped to the ground simultaneously.

She glanced up and saw her Nassu-bots, floating gently in the air, sniper rifles in hand.

Three dropped to the ground behind her, and Suzie smiled grimly, entering the facility.

The first guard barely had a chance to draw his weapon before Suzie's elbow broke his windpipe and he collapsed to the ground gasping for air.

The second wasn't as easy, grabbing a nearby doctor as a hostage.

A Nassu-bot's precise shot ended that tirade.

The doctor became collateral, and so they kept moving.

By the time they'd found the room where Nassu had said Arlia should be located, eighteen guards were dead and two doctors were timid hostages.

Suzie paused as she entered the room.

There she was.

Her daughter, so young.

Barely a year old.

The girl was smiling happily, playing with a loaded gun, sitting in the lap of a guard.

He glared at her, "Make your move, bitch."

Suzie clenched a fist, "Language. Children present."

The guard laughed, "Not for long if you don't back off."

Suzie crouched down, on eye level with her daughter, "Arlia... Do you remember what mummy taught you?"

Arlia smiled girlishly, "Protocol Twenty One?"

Arcs of electricity shot out of the toddler, evicerating the man.

She dropped to the ground, ignoring the gun, and waddled over, grabbing her mother as Suzie swept her up, tears running down her face.

Arlia frowned, "Bad men not so bad, mummy."

Suzie looked at her daughter sadly, "But?"

"Bad men still bad." The toddler growled, and she felt relief flow through her, holding her tight, "That's right, baby girl."

---

Suzie paused outside her house, looking at the single man waiting for her.

She put Arlia down gently, "Go inside with Nassu, okay?"

Arlia grabbed tight, "No. No. No. I want you!"

Suzie brushed her blonde her gently, "No one's going to take me away, Arlia. You're safe with Nassu, and I will be inside soon. I'm not going anywhere."

Arlia crossed her arms, "Promise."

"I promise." She said with a smile, and a nearby Nassu-bot held out a hand. The toddler clutched it and tried to walk whilst looking back.

Suzie glared at Quinn as she walked up, the rest going inside, "What the hell do you want?"

"You got your daughter back."

Suzie sneered, "Surprised?"

"Nope." Quinn shook his head, "But she's a bit developed isn't she? For a one year old?"

"Runs in the family." Suzie shrugged it off.

Quinn sighed heavily, "The USB you found on Styles contained the virus system they used to take the internet offline. We've developed something to counteract it."

"Cool. Not my problem." Suzie growled.

Quinn winced, "Actually... It is. The Homegrown Front are still an issue. The UHF weren't lying about them. They are out there, and they are dangerous. In light of that, the Five Eyes are... Re-grouping. Reunited as any informal group ever is. They're willing to pardon you, and all your crimes, if you aid us in removing the threat."

"If anyone in the Five Eyes has any sense, they will leave me and my family alone, forever." Suzie growled, "It's better for everyone that way."

Quinn shrugged, "I don't have that sort of power, Drakes. I don't want you on my team. You killed the best witness we've ever had in cold blood. You've got a vendetta, and some serious anger issues. I don't want that, you'll get me and my people killed. But they want you. So it's a pardon, or they will come gunning for you, and they will eliminate you."

Suzie shook her head, "In China: Eric Matthews, Huan King, Lam Mao, Kim Sung. In Russia, Alik Semenov, Adrik Ivanov, Andrei Aleksandrov. That's just a few."

Quinn cocked his head, "A few what?"

"Agents in deep cover. I have more. If anyone in those five intelligence communities make a move for me or mine... The respective intelligence communities will be informed. The packet they will recieve will include the deep cover mole's exit strategy." Suzie shook her head, "You tell the boys in the Five Eyes that."

"I'll call it in." Quinn said and shook his head, "You could have been so much more, Drakes."

"I was dead, Quinn." Suzie growled, "I came out of hiding to take the UHF down. Styles was the mysterious hacker, afterall. And now? I've done it. I'm done. Now take your NSA, and get the fuck out of my life."
