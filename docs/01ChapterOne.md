# Chapter One

The chef moved her head back as the fire flared in the pan for a moment, and she spun around, looking over at one her juniors as he moved into her place, and she resumed slicing the vegetables at an incredible speed with absolute precision, "What's going on out there?" 

The young cook laughed, "Some dickhead called Angela fat, and said that she better waddle faster if she wanted him to stick around." 

The chef stopped, lowering the knife slowly onto the board, "He what?" 

"It's just an asshole, chef." 

She shook her head, the blonde ponytail bobbing behind her, "No." 

The chef strode out into the restaurant, throwing open both doors dramatically, instantly spotting the man sitting in his seat, a look of scorn etched onto his face. 

She walked over, tapping Angela on the shoulder, and the waitress smiled her thanks and ducked back towards the kitchen. "What seems to be the problem, sir?" 

"Your slow." He glared, "Your servers suck. They move slow, and never ask the right damn questions. I just wanted a nice meal. This seemed like a nice place." 

The chef laughed softly, "Really? Well, from what I can see, you came here with a motive, not a hunger. You didn't want a nice meal. The notepad in your jacket pocket tells me you are a critic. Your weight and face tell me you suffer from diabetes, and probably a heart condition." 

The man glared, pointing a finger, "You listen here!" 

"I'm not finished." She growled, as the restaurant descended into an awkward silence, "The reason that you find it fun to pick on my staff, is that you enjoy playing the part of the bully. Has something to do with the scar on your right shoulder, and the fact that you were bullied right up till the day you became a more liked critic than the others around you. You were always at the bottom of the food chain, all the way up till… I'd say a couple weeks or months ago. You're still actually being bullied, but you don't quite realise it. That being said, I'd look for a new career. You'll be fired in a couple days, considering the pressure your boss is putting you under." 

The man stared at her, slack jawed, "How did… How did you know about my scar? I'm wearing a suit." 

She smiled, "You are a repugnant type of person. You enjoy making others feel fear, and you are terrified that they will realise that you like pain. It makes you dizzy with ecstasy. Something a lot of people like, by the way. But what isn't normal, is the fact that you are nothing more than a heroin addict. The way your pupils dilate, and the scars on your arm… They tell it all… You… You are nothing." 

The man stood up angrily, "I've had enough of this bullshit!" 

"Tell that to your father." She said softly, and the man froze up, looking at her, "Wh-what?" 

She shrugged, "Your father. The man who beat you black and blue with a belt for eight years? Before your mother killed him? … You found the body didn't you?" 

The tears welled in the man's eyes, "You can't know that. Nobody knows that." 

"Everyone knows a soul that has been tortured when they see it. And you… You're a victim. A weak man who has tried to cover the shame he feels… When it was never your fault. Your father was just a fucking bastard. Time to accept that, and move on. He should never have done what he did, and as for your mother… She should have thought about her two children instead of ending her own life in grief… But grief buries all your wants and needs, doesn't it? Because you are still grieving, and you need to go talk to someone about it." 

The man burst into tears, and she sighed heavily, "I have the number of a good therapist if you want it." 

He turned and ran from the restaurant, and she rolled her eyes, "You can't run forever…" 

She looked at the restaurant, people staring at her in shock, and she shrugged nonchalantly, "Nobody picks on my staff."

She tossed her jacket into the waiting wash basket and collapsed backwards into the arm chair. She didn't particularly care that the house was a mess - it was convenient. She led a busy life. 

She grabbed the remote from behind her head, swiveling to face the TV and flicked it on, and blinked in surprise as she saw emergency news. 

"For those just joining us, the internet blackout today was global - it lasted twelve minutes, beginning and ending at the same time across the world. Computer experts are baffled. Meanwhile, the police in many countries are launching joint taskforces to identify and capture this man." 

She tuned out from what the reporter was saying, staring at the image of the hacker, and grabbed a nearby tablet computer and fired it up, scanning social media and news websites. 

It had been a global broadcast. 

That was just… Impressive. 

Taking down the internet was one thing, but managing to hack into that many screens, screens not traditionally connected to the internet, all at once? 

The hacker must have used a high tech device, something capable of frequency manipulation. 

She rubbed her face, "Oh fucking ballshit." 

She flicked open her email program, finding the email address of Anna Doherty, and typed quickly. 

"The hacker incident today is just the beginning. Whoever was behind it has some technology that is built outside the normal rules. They aren't a hacker. They're a scientist or an engineer. The threat they made has more to do with hubris than belief. Expect that they will attempt to disable the internet on a permanent basis. Soon. 

I can help you find them. 

Suzie Drakes." 

*** 

Suzie's head snapped up and the computer tumbled from her grasp to the floor as she jerked awake. She blinked furiously, staring in surprise, at the officers walking through her front door. 

She stood up slowly, rubbing her head, regretting how much wine she ingested in the night as she fought with herself over her decision to reach out. 

One of the officers held out a narrow slip of paper, "Warrant. Search and seize on all electronic records." 

She laughed, "Wow. You guys found me fast and all… But you aren't going to find anything." 

The officer glared at her, "Excuse me?" 

"Dude, no one on earth can crack the encryption that is on all my stuff. Seriously, it'd take me nearly six months. It's beyond anything any of your techs have ever seen." 

The officer glared, "Give us the goddamn passwords." 

She cocked her head, "Passwords? What self-respecting tech uses passwords? It's encrypted using keys, and a key for this particular system is about four thousand characters long. I can't just hand it over." 

The officer pulled some cuffs from behind him, "You are under arrest, for resisting and withholding evidence, Miss Ambrosius." 

She rolled her eyes, holding out her wrists, "Whatever. Idiot." 

*** 

Suzie half lay in the cold metal chair, rubbing her temples, as the heavy wooden door creaked open and tired looking detective shuffled in and tossed a folder of papers onto the desk. 

He sat down opposite her, and glared, "You look a bit calm for someone being accused of international espionage." 

"Espionage?" She said with a raised eyebrow and laughed, "You just keep tacking on the charges, don't you?" 

"False name, false death." The man shrugged, "Six months ago you were supposed to have died. I saw the commemoration on the TV. Yet… Here she is. 'The' Susan Drakes." 

Her face grew tight and she glared at him, "Let's get some facts straight. First, people who call me Susan tend to get their skull caved in. Second, I offered to find the freak, not help him. Third, I died so that people would stop chasing me. I don't exactly want to be any part of all this mess. But I don't think you can find him without me." 

The officer laughed, "We have some smart people on our side." 

"Do you remember Josiah McIntyre? Smartest man in the world?" She asked, glaring, and the officer shrugged, "Yeah. What of it? He kinda disappeared after he accidentally managed to wipe out the power." 

She smiled softly, "I put him in prison. I was seventeen." 

The officer blinked, "What? A seventeen year old girl put McIntyre in prison? How's that?" 

"He blew off my ankle, and I bashed in his face. Also, I'm smarter than he is." She said and shrugged, "I know exactly how the hacker seized control of the TVs worldwide, though." 

The interviewer paused, "Excuse me? You know how the hacker did something impossible?" 

She smiled as sweetly as she could, "That's right… But I'm only going to talk to Anna Doherty." 

Suzie's face dropped back into a glare, "Now fuck off."
