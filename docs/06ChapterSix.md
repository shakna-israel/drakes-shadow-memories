# Chapter Six

~~~

How many must die,
how many must fall,
till her will is broken?

Her mentor and master,
fighting for causes unknown,
burned out at the last of moments.

- Rising, anon.

~~~

The air was clean, putridly so. 

Her hand rubbed her face, wincing as the harsh lights confirmed her suspicions and she pushed herself upright, looking at the hospital wing. 

She had a bedside table with a phone, a bed and a TV, and a drip in her arm. 

Suzie grabbed the needle and drew it out slowly, feeling the relief as it left, and dropped it to the side. 

Then she picked up the phone and dialed the front desk, to which a very tired voice answered, "Reception, how can I help?" 

"Suzie Drakes. Any calls for me?" She asked, keeping her voice steady and terse, and the man at the other end groaned, "About time. I have had seventy six calls logged for you in the last two hours. Some idiot called Steven Quinn." 

She laughed, "Right. Can you connect me to him?" 

A dial tone met her ear, and then an irate Quinn answered, "About time! Is she awake?" 

"Yep." 

She heard him sigh with relief, "What the hell was that, Drakes? You pretty much went into a coma from a taser." 

Suzie winced, "I'm not exactly used to the battlefield anymore, Quinn. Lighten up. I never really adjusted my new nerve system to be prepared for electrical discharges. Never expected to be struck by lightning. It must have been acting up." 

Quinn passed, "… New nerve system?" 

Suzie laughed, "No nerve damage anymore. Remember? McIntyre crippled me. I... Un-crippled me." 

Quinn seemed to sigh at the other end, "So... Any chance of a cup of coffee at that place?" 

"I'd rather drink floor cleaner." Suzie replied and grinned, "How about you, aren't you meant to be a super-spy? How did they manage to get the drop on you?" 

His voice was warm, and steady, without hesitation, "If I was a super spy, wouldn't I drive a fast car and date lusty women who go head over heels for no reason?" 

An awkwardness stretched between them. 

Suzie winced, trying to think of something to say. 

"… Uh... Um... Anyway..." Quinn tried to recover, "The attack on the prison was professional. These men were contract killers, hired by people who knew how to find them. They were a good team that has been on the radar for a while." 

Suzie swung her legs over the bed, wincing, "Wait... Hell... This Edward Poole, you got a photo on file?" 

"We do." Quinn responded cautiously, "You have an idea?" 

"I know who did it, Quinn. I might not know what name he uses now, but I know exactly who this is. The psych profile is dead on, and he has all the skills and motivation that you would need." She paused, grabbing her clothes from the bedside table, "I'll meet you downstairs." 

*** 

Quinn shrugged as Suzie tapped away on the tablet as the car roared down the street, "So, there a good reason you're out of hospital already? Civilian consultant that you are?" 

Suzie rolled her eyes, and turned the tablet to face him, "Look familiar?" 

Quinn cocked his head, "Similar facial structures... Who is he?" 

Suzie zoomed out, revealing an ASIO Person-Of-Interest profile, "Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Styles." 

Quinn took the tablet and skimmed it, "Wait... He's dead." 

Suzie winced, "Three days after McIntyre tried to use a QNN to take out... The world." 

Quinn frowned, tapping his chin as he read, "You're right... The profile matches... Styles attended a lot of Open Source conferences and that type of thing... Seems to have had a thing for A.I... But he's dead. Heart attack, when under observation by ASIO. Seems a bit tight. I'm not sure they would hide him." 

Suzie shrugged, "I died too." 

He handed the tablet back to her, "We'll look into it... But I'm not sure." 

He paused, grabbing his phone out of his pocket as it rang, "Quinn." 

He went white and put it on speaker, "...we will blow up Central Hospital if you do not allow us to speak to Susan Drakes!" 

"Speaking." She growled angrily, and the voice on the other end changed, softening, "We have followed your work closely, Miss Drakes. You are... A one of a kind mind, that has been victimised by so many-" 

She interrupted, "Cut to the chase, asshole." 

"We knew you would return. Your death did not hold up under scrutiny." The voice began, and Suzie sighed, "Who are you, and what do you want?" 

"We represent the United Humanitarian Front, we wish to help you, with this current situation, and this man who believes that the networks of the world belong to him, alone. We want you to lead us." 

Quinn glanced at her carefully, and Suzie let out a sound of annoyance, "You threaten to destroy lives, and then say that you care about saving them? The means do not justify the ends... Those that say so, and the ones who have to justify themselves when death comes calling." 

She clenched her fists, "But... You can be of use. Find me Styles." 

The man on the other end hesitated, "Styles? Like... Clothing?" 

"Look at my history, idiot." She growled, and the voice spoke slowly, "You wish for us to find the body of DCI Styles?" 

"He's not dead." Suzie said confidently, "If you think he is... Prove it. Call me when you have something." 

"As you wish, Miss Drakes." 

The caller hung up and Quinn looked at her, "Who were they?" 

Suzie shrugged, "No idea." 

*** 

Quinn sighed heavily, putting aside the sixth coffee cup of the night, "You getting anywhere?" 

Suzie shrugged nonchalantly, "Somewhere... I know who the United Humanitarian Front is... And they aren't exactly... United... They're a ragtag bunch of hackers from all over the world with common beliefs and goals. Other than that... They've pretty much never been on anyone's radar. They're fairly disorganised, and they've never ever issued a threat. More stolen a bunch of email passwords and posted them online." 

Quinn winced, "So... Somebody new is in charge. More focused, less qualms... More motivation to get things done." 

She shrugged, "Probably. Still doesn't explain how anybody could actually seize control of a group like that. Most of the time they just splinter off into tiny groups that hurt themselves more than anybody else... It takes a special sort of person to actually inspire people to action." 

The Director of the NSA looked at her and laughed, "Somebody like you, Drakes?" 

She paused, "Never thought of it that way... I'm not that special. Just the right person in the wrong place, most of the time." 

Quinn shrugged, and then his phone vibrated on the table, he tapped it and frowned, "How are you feeling?" 

She looked over at him, "Why?" 

"The guy who was going to kill you, wants to talk." 

Suzie sighed, "But only to me, right?" 

Quinn shrugged and she shook her head, "Does that line ever get old?" 

He stood up and stretched, "Let's just get the information out of this jerk. Things are going stale out here, and the man we're hunting is ten steps ahead." 

*** 

Suzie sat down across the metal table from a fairly strong looking man, a few tattoos up his heavily muscled arms, ending at his wrists that were magnetically clamped to the table. 

He smiled at her, revealing several chipped teeth, "Finally, it is an honour, Miss Drakes." 

She blinked, "Wish I could say the same. Who are you?" 

"A man whose anger got to him. I am sorry for threatening to kill you in the manner that I did, it was unforgiveable. It was not part of the actions for which I was instructed." His English was precise, concise and just a tad bit Oxford. 

Suzie rolled her eyes, "No, your orders were just to kill Josiah McIntyre." 

"I am surprised that you are not thankful, considering what that man did to you in the past," his voice held just a tiny mote of shock, "Miss Drakes." 

Suzie smiled weakly, "So... I guess what you're telling me, is that your employer doesn't want me hurt." 

"That would be correct, Miss Drakes." 

Suzie shrugged, "So why has he killed everyone around me, thus far?" 

"Much pain has come, and much more must. It is an unfortunate side-effect of the current circumstances, but much more good shall come of this." His eyes were earnest, understanding. 

Suzie laughed softly, "You really believe that, don't you? That some idiot causing an international incident can bring about more good than hurt?" 

"Has the United Humanitarian Front contacted you yet?" His voice was steady, but his eyes were watching her, awaiting a response. 

Suzie cocked her head, "Your boss utilise them for the network blackout?" 

The man shook his head, "No, no, no. That's the wrong idea, entirely. Shutting down the Internet was a ruse. Threatening to make it permanent, moreso. It was designed to bring several small groups out into the open, so that they can be eliminated as a threat. Of these groups, the UHF has been considered the most dangerous by those I have been employed by. A sequence of snapshots of the data was taken throughout the shutdown. That data is currently being analysed. Thus far, there is one thing that has been determined from that data. Josiah McIntyre was a lieutenant for the new commander of the UHF. Thus was his threat, and our response." 
Suzie frowned, tapping her fingers on the table slowly, "… Really?" 

"Yes... There is one more thing my employers were keen that you should know. There is an encrypted packet being used in a handshake signal, that we have been able to pull apart." The man paused, hesitant, and Suzie cocked an eyebrow, "Yes?" 

"It translates to 'Where is Arlia?'" 

She shot to her feet, one hand grabbing his head and jerking him backwards with surprising speed and strength, knocking his chair aside and leaving him dangling, "How do you know that name?" 

The man swallowed, in obvious pain, but Quinn intervened, "Enough. He doesn't know crap, Drakes." 

She knew it was true. 

But the anger flowing through her wanted something, anything, to unleash itself onto. 

She closed her eyes, focusing, and dropped the man. 

*** 

Quinn glared at Suzie as they emerged into the office, and she winced, "I know I lost it. Sorry." 

He shook his head, "That man knows a lot. Why did you do that? It was bait." 

"You haven't lost what I have." She growled, her fists clenching with a squeal of metal, and Quinn stared at her, "What the hell did you do to yourself?" 

"I'm not about to tell you." Suzie snapped, "I have helped the Five Eyes on multiple occasions. I have been a field agent since before I finished high school. This life has brought nothing but pain, and telling anyone anything about the things I can do has led to death, and more death. I lost my family, Quinn. That's never going to happen again." 

He sighed heavily, "Arlia. Your daughter. Geoffrey Whitlam had her tortured on live TV." 

Suzie paused, breathing hard, putting her forehead against a window, using the cool to ease her pounding head. "… Yes." 

"You killed him. The entire group were wiped out." Quinn stated, "You were declared dead, the MI5 agents captured. It was all over." 

"No." Suzie stated, feeling exhaustion hitting her, "No, Quinn, it isn't. He was supposedly part of some terrorist group from the 80s, linked with the Soviet Union... But he was an ASIO agent. High ranking. Enough to be able to pull my file, and everything in it." 

Quinn paused, "So what motivated him?" 

She turned to face him, fighting back the tears, "No idea. I don't even know who was part of his organisation. I left it all behind. The only way... To keep living... Was to accept that I was dead. Everyone I knew, and everything I was, I left it behind. I gave up. I don't want to know the truth. I was... I was starting to move forward. I had a life... And now... Now this." 

Quinn winced, "I didn't mean to drag you into all of this. I just wanted to protect you." 

Suzie smiled tightly, "Better than idiots torturing me... But now... Now I just want to go home." 

Quinn glanced down at his phone and winced, "That... That's not going to happen. ASIO has issued a warrant for your arrest." 

Suzie spun and punched the glass, causing the bulletproof window to buckle, splintering outwards as it cracked.
