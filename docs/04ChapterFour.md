# Chapter Four

~~~

Among the giants of old,
amongst the tales and myths,
her hammer shall strike,
as one of the Vanir.

- Rising, anon.

Quinn winced as he saw the elevator open, and Suzie dragged the screaming man in and dropped him to the ground. 

"What happened?" 

Suzie glared down at the man, "This man was waiting for me. He shot Walsh the moment the door opened. I was luckier." 

The man swallowed, looking from one to the other, "What are you going to do to me?" 

Quinn crouched, and rubbed his hands, "You killed one of my men. You were part of a trap that killed four of my people… We killed your two colleagues." 

The man swallowed nervously, "I didn't know them. Didn't know they were there." 

Suzie smiled and then kicked violently, and the man screamed as her foot connected with his arm. "So… Who hired you, and how?" 

The mercenary stared at her, "Holy… Shit…" 

She glared down at him, and clenched her fists in anger, "Excuse me? That didn't sound like an answer… And you know I'm just waiting for an excuse to hurt you." 

The man glared, "Are you kidding me?" 

Quinn touched the man's shoulder, a finger pushing gently against a nerve cluster and the man swallowed, but Suzie shook her head, "Pain's not going to work, Quinn… Not that kind, anyway." 

Quinn stood up, brushing his hands, "So what, then?" 

She smiled softly, "The sister." 

The mercenary's face fell, "Sister? You can't know I have a sister." 

She shrugged, "But, I do." 

He swallowed nervously, "What do you know?" 

"She lives in a flat, she's blonde, and she tends to buy you beer… Not sure what brand." Suzie grinned and shrugged, "Do I need to tell you the suburb? Or are you going to cooperate? If you don't… I have zero feeling about murdering her." 

Quinn's face tremored, but the mercenary nodded, "Fine… What do you need to know?" 

"How were you hired?" Suzie growled, and the man winced, "I don't know. It was an online advert, looking for skilled shooters, and few morals. Paid by credit card… To kill you, miss." 

Quinn glanced over at her as Drakes cocked her head, "Kill me? Really?" 

The mercenary winced, "I got paid one point eight million dollars. In advance. Figured they were serious people… So I turned up." 

Suzie laughed, "I'm not sure what the smart move should have been. Running from them… Or me." 

Quinn frowned, "Credit card? We could trace that." 

"Waste of effort." Drakes said and shrugged, "He's already inside the banks." 
She crouched slowly, "The online advert… Did you print it?" 

The mercenary nodded, "Yeah. They tend to delete them as soon as they hire… So I did. It's… At my sisters." 

Drakes smiled and stood, looking over at Quinn, "If the hacker can guess where your team heads to… They'll die." 

Quinn laughed and picked an earpiece of a table, "Then you talk them through it." 

*** 

Suzie sat, her eyes closed, focusing on an internal map, traffic patterns, and the placement of cameras throughout the city. 

The team she was directing weren't entirely happy that they were taking orders from an Australian, who was young and inexperienced, and had been out of the game. 

They were also terrified. 

She winced, "Shit… Turn left now. Right now." 

She heard a screech, and a scramble of screams, and swallowed softly, "Team, do you copy?" 

"This is Agent Mason. Cut that a little close. Sniper shot hit barely a foot in front of us… Anymore surprises?" The man growled angrily, and Suzie winced, "Sniper shot… Which building? The ten-tier or thirty-six next to it?" 

The agent swallowed nervously, the sound of the engine purring as they drove, "The ten." 

Suzie winced, "Turn right in four seconds." 

The van screeched over the radio, and she heard another shot hit the ground, and Mason swore again, "What was that?" 

"Shut up." Suzie growled, estimating their speed and traffic, whilst trying to triangulate the third sniper. 

There should only be three. 

"You're about to hit a gap in the traffic, when you do, floor it. If you don't, you'll die." She said slowly, and she waited, knuckles white as her fists clenched against the cold table in front of her. 

The vehicle revved, and Mason swore angrily, "He hit us!" 

"You're not dead. Spin right, head down the alley. Should be clear from there." She said softly and eased back in her seat, "So… Agent Mason… You in sight of the property?" 

"Just arriving now… It’s a simple apartment style complex." He said, and she heard the van door open and swallowed, "Check the door. Carefully, without touching it or breathing on it… In fact use a scope." 

"Really? Use a sniper scope just to check a door?" Mason complained, and she tightened her fists, "Yes!" 

The man muttered a series of curse words directed at her, and then paused, "Seven wires visible through the crack on the door. Two red, two green, one blue, one yellow, one black." 

Suzie winced, "Explosives device… I need more information… What can you see on thermals?" 

"Uh… There's a box maybe a foot across, fairly square in shape. Emitting less heat than a small animal." Mason said without understanding, and Suzie swallowed, "Mmm… Can you judge if it is connected to the doorbell?" 

"Huh… It might be. Cables kind of suggest it." 

Suzie smiled softly, "Rightio… Let's try and defuse it. Which of your team?" 

"This is Agent Radcliffe. My duty." A young nervous voice spoke, and she frowned, "Approach with caution. It’s not a heat sensitive bomb, that we call tell, but it will probably be vibration triggered, so you're going to have to be really damn careful. I think I know what kind of bomb it is, but I will need constant feedback, understood?" 

"Yes, ma'am." 

"You need to strip the black wire, and the yellow, but don't let them touch yet." 

She heard some fumbling and then, "Attempting to strip the black wire… How am I meant to do this without vibrating it?" 

"There's a new tool in your kit, the NSA built it off of one of my designs. Looks sort of like a fork, but with a battery pack." Suzie said slowly, and Radcliffe swallowed, "Right. What does this do?" 

"Melts stuff. What thickness do you figure on the wire? Try and be precise." Suzie asked, measuring out each of her words, the man seemed uncertain, "Umm… Somewhere around zero point one-five inches?" 

Suzie ran it through her head, "So, standard five millimeter gauge wire. Set your new favourite tool it to four." 

The man did as instructed, and she smiled, "Test it. It'll burn anything in between the forks, to a certain distance from the center. Put the wire in the middle, and use it, it'll melt the wires for you." 

"The center? What if I don't get it right?" Radcliffe asked nervously and she sighed heavily, "The bomb will go off." 

"Oh shit." 

She smiled, "Agent, you've got this. You just survived a trio of snipers. A bomb? This is easy." 

Quinn touched her shoulder, and Suzie glanced up at him, "Won't there be someone waiting? If there's a bomb?" 

Suzie nodded and covered the mike, "They don't need to know that yet." 

She closed her eyes, focusing back on the task, "Wires stripped?" 

"Yes, ma'am… Now?" 

Suzie smiled, "We're disconnecting the bomb, and plugging it in to a battery. This is… Delicate. Can you describe the doorbell?" 

"Uh… Something I've seen before. Some cheap system you can get at any store." Radcliffe said quickly, stumbling on his words, and she winced, "Uh… More info. Can you see a brand name? Maybe there's one on the bottom, or top?" 

"Uh… Swanne?" 

She smiled, "Awesome. How wide is it? An inch?" 

"That's about right." Radcliffe responded and Suzie breathed a sigh of relief, "Sweet. You need to hook two AA batteries in. Set them up, and then hook them onto the exposed wires, glue the battery pack to the door, and then cut the connection after the batteries from the door… And you can throw it open." 

Radcliffe breathed heavily for a few moments, and then he spoke, "Cutting the handle from the door… It's open. Bomb didn't go off." 

Suzie swallowed, "Watch for trip wires on your way in. Mason, take the lead." 

"We're on the way -" A burst of static hit her, and Suzie winced, tapping her ear, "What the hell? Mason, Radcliffe? Do you read?" 

She swore and detached the earpiece, and answered Quinn's look, "Frequency jammer…" Her eyes darted around the room and then she glared and grabbed the laptop, flipping it over and smashing the casing open. Quinn stared as she grabbed a handful of pieces, and then pulled the casing of her microphone open. 

The wires assembled, and she swallowed, "I need something to solder with…" 

Quinn grabbed for his pocket and pulled out a cigarette lighter, "Will this work?" 

She smiled and flicked the flame open and finished her wiring and put the bulky thing against her head, holding it in place, "Agent Mason, do you read me?" 

"Holy fuck! We are under heavy fire here!" 

She winced, hearing the machine gun fire burst across the room, "Where from?" 

"No fucking clue! It's all around us! We're on the second floor!" He roared over the explosions. 

She frowned and grabbed a pen, sketching a square onto the table, "Describe the room to me." 

"Bunch of couches, and paintings. The door is in the middle of the wall." 

She winced, "Open plan?" 

"Yes. Uh… Two bedrooms nearby, and lounge to the right?" 

Suzie nodded and sketched, "Tell me about the wall near the door. Spread of bullets." 

"Most shots near the back right corner… To the right of the door, on the inside." Mason corrected himself as he started to comprehend, "There's a light splattering, easing off as it goes across." 

"How high from the floor?" Suzie asked as she began to sketch some equations out next to the drawing of the room. 

"Most are about a four feet high. Nothing below two feet." 

Suzie grinned, "I know where they are, captain… Hold your men in place." 

She spun and grabbed another laptop, pulling up the commandline and remote accessing a very specific server, she spoke over her shoulder to Quinn, "I really hate this bastard… He's using one of our own playbooks." 

Quinn frowned, "Is using a computer, especially reaching out across the Internet, dangerous?" 

"Yes." Suzie said, clenching her jaw, "But this is the only way that your men stay alive." 

She hit the enter key and cut the connection. 

"That'll work." 

She tapped her microphone, "Mason, you stay alive for five minutes, maybe six, and you and yours will come out of this alive." 

"Really? Why's that?" 

Suzie smiled, "There's a drone inbound. It's going to blow itself up in the building next door. It should wipe out the two gunners attacking you. They're on the first floor." 

Mason laughed, "A drone? In a civilian environment? You flying it?" 

"It flies itself." Suzie said and smiled, "Once it's given an order, it cuts all external communications. It ejects the wireless connector. There's no way to hack it that I know of… Well, not when its moving at these sorts of speeds." 

Mason sounded nervous, "This guy ain't normal." 

"Neither am I, haven't I proved that yet?" She said with a smile, and the captain sounded back, "Affirmative." 

They didn't have to wait long. 

Suzie's microphone screeched as the explosion sounded, the next she heard was much quieter, "This is Agent Mason. We're in the room, and have the printout." 

Suzie smiled, "What's it say?" 

"Pay by credit card, service is for servicemen, or the like. Gang affiliations acceptable." 

*** 

Suzie glanced at the van, and the agents tucked inside in their armour, and she raised an eyebrow slowly, "There's only room for one in there." 

The agent standing outside nodded, and Quinn frowned, "Not me?" 

"No. Just her." The agent said pointing at Suzie, who shrugged, "Fine." 

Quinn stared at her, "These people had you in prison. Have you forgotten what ASIO is?" 

"Nope." She said with a smile and stepped into the truck, sandwiched between eight agents, and then the doors slammed shut. 

One of them, sitting opposite her, glared, "So, we get to take the little coward to McIntyre." 

Suzie looked at him skeptically, "Coward? Really?" 

"You're just a bitch." He sneered, "Nothing but a wuss. You're weak. We got you… And you went crying to the NSA." 

Her jaw tensed and she glared, "You are twenty one. You were picked up off the street by ASIO, because of your gang affiliations. You were an okay enforcer, but better deep cover mole… Except you screwed that up and agents died. But not all was bad… ASIO found out that you are pretty good at killing people. Except for the fact where you want to kill yourself every night." 

The agent's eyes widened and he went to punch her, but Suzie's hands snapped up, and the agent screamed as blood flicked into the air, bone gaping out of his wrist. 

She pushed him into a sitting position as seven guns pointed at her, she glared, "Dude, seriously? I've been out of the game for years… I can still kick your ass." 

She let go and leaned back, and shrugged, "Guys… I'm not your enemy. You're taking me where I want to go… Let's not be enemies." 

The captain of the team laughed, "This one's got balls, gentlemen. Lower your guns."
