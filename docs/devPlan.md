# Prologue 

A hacker broadcasts a message to the entire world, on every publicly accessible screen. 

Says that, 'for the good of all, living, dead and corrupted' he will shut down the entire internet. 

To demonstrate that he can, there is a 12 minute internet outage across the globe. 

# Chapter One 

Female chef in a bar hears one of her staff being berated and walks into the main lobby, and excuses the waiter. She speaks with the customer, and then tears him apart, analysing him piece by piece, making him burst into tears. 

As he leaves, she sneers, "Nobody picks on my staff." 

*** 

Chef collapses into seat at home, with a glass of wine. She turns on the TV and sees the hacker incident. 

"Oh fucking ballshit." 

She sends an email to Anna Doherty, offering to help track the bastard down, signs the email "Suzie Drakes". 

Internal monologue about running from her past, and how much she had lost. The inevitability of her return - she cares too much to stay away. 

*** 

Suzie has her door kicked down by officers, wakes up in her chair, knocking a tablet computer onto the floor as she jerked awake. 

Lead officer produces a warrant, search and seize all electronic records. 

Bursts out laughing. 

"Encrypted beyond anything your techs have ever seen." 

Arrested for not giving up passwords, "There are no passwords, idiot. It's key encrypted." 

*** 

Interrogation, Suzie is withdrawn and casual. Blames hangover. 

When interviewer starts getting angry claims she knows how hacker managed to seize control of the broadcast network worldwide. 

Interviewer stops and stares, and Suzie smiles sweetly, "But, I'm only going to talk to Anna Doherty. Now... Fuck off." 

# Chapter Two 

A depressed woman wearing a pink hoodie and track suit pants enters the containment room, waking Suzie up as she slams the door. 

Suzie winces when she sees her, didn't think the closure of the Joint Terrorism Analysis taskforce would hit her so badly. 

Apologies for dragging her into the mess. Thought Anna would be working for the NSA. 

Anna is shocked - they did approach her for a job, asks her Drakes knew. "I'm very good at math. It was a near certainty." 

Anna shrugs and asks what Drakes knew about the hacker. 

"It's someone trained personally by Josiah McIntyre. I recognized the style. You need to bring me to him, so I can show him the code used." 

Anna stares in surprise, surprised that McIntyre wasn't dead. 

*** 

Interviewer refuses Suzie access to McIntyre. 

Suzie refuses to cooperate. 

They torture her. 

*** 

Anna pleads with Suzie to give them something, anything to make them stop. 

Maybe a little cooperation and they'll do what she wants. 

Suzie gets angry - she never had to help. She could have ignored it as someone else's problem. 

She had been living her own life, after having everyone she ever cared about killed. 

Australia had named her a hero in the public eye. 

So fuck 'em, she'd given enough. 

*** 

Head of NSA, Steven Quinn, arrives to talk with Suzie. 

He shocks her by understanding techno talk and knowing how the hacker did his broadcast. 

But she did it faster, alone, so he wants to work with her. 

She would be passed into his custody if she would allow it, and pro.ise not to run or get involved in any physical confrontation. 

Laughs and says that a fight was inevitable, but she'll do her best. 

*** 

# Chapter Three 

Suzie is given her own office space, and rambles to herself as she tries to trace the hacker or find out who imhe is from the code and a repository created by several McIntyre employees. 

She freezes, terrified, when her computer freezes and a recorded voice speaks over her speakers, telling her, "Don't fly too close to the sun, little Icarus, your wings might melt." 

Then her computer switches off. 

She is floored, and shakes her head in astonishment, "How the hell did you get through my security?" 

*** 

NSA unit is analyzing Suzie's laptop as she and Quinn discuss gaining access to McIntyre. Quinn says AZIO is stalling, but might budge if she gave them something. 

Suzie says hacker would likely attempt to have McIntyre assassinated, and points out that money is no object when most banks use cloud based technologies to let their clients transfer money. 

Quinn asks if any computer system is safe from a hacker like the one they were facing, and Suzie points out isolated systems were probably safe, but most banks hadn't shut down internet enabled systems because of customer complaints. Quinn orders his unit to isolate their systems. 

Then he calls ASIO, on speakerphone. 

Angry man refuses to allow Nsa access to McIntyre and demands that Drakes be handed back over to them. 

Drakes laughs and tells him that their system is compromised, and that the hacker already knew the location of McIntyre, because though the data was only in hard copy, it had been electronic first and the file hadn't been deleted securely. 

Man swears and hangs up. 

Quinn stares at Drakes, "Just bluffing. Its how I would do it." 

*** 

Sniper begins shooting people in the building. Quinn gets Drakes to elevator with another agent, Greg Walsh, and the two descend to ground floor. Drakes tries to get to know him, a d keep him calm, through nervous small talk. 

Walsh is killed when the door opens. 

Drakes swears and maims lone gunner. 

Drags him back into elevator and waits for the all clear. 

*** 

# Chapter Four 

Quinn and Drakes interrogate gunner, discover he was paid via credit card, 1.8 million dollars to assassinate Drakes. 

Quinn asks if she could trace it, she says that would be a wasted effort, and instead asks about how he was contacted. 

Ad on Craigslist. 

Asks if the man made a copy, and he says he printed a copy but left it in a temporary apartment. 

Quinn mobilises team to go get it. 

Drakes warns that if the hacker can guess where the team is headed, they'll arrive in a trap. 

Quinn passes her a mike, "Then talk them through it." 

*** 

Drakes talks an annoyed but scared team through, arriving at the apartment, avoiding three snipers. 

They deactivate an explosive on the door with her help, and then they get cut off. 

Suzie swears angrily, frequency jammer. 

She pulls apart her microphone and a nearby laptop, and rewires it, and reconnects with the team, albeit badly. 

Team is under heavy fire from a nearby building. Suzie draws equations on the table, and determines room, floor and building. 

She gets angry and deploys a drone from her house. Drone destroys room and itself, and team recover, signal jammer deactivated. 

Quinn is shocked. 

Team recover ad and read it to Suzie who memorises it. 

*** 

ASIO let Suzie, alone, interview McIntyre. 

She is escorted by eight agents in the back of.a truck. One agent angrily taunts her for being a wuss and weakling. 

Suzie tears him apart, and breaks his wrist when he tries to punch her. 

She smiles, "I've been out of the game for years. I can still kick your ass." 

# Chapter Five 

Suzie meets McIntyre, and is filled with hatred and love. Remembers working with him. Laughter. Remembers stopping him. 

McIntyre is chained to the table with four gunners focused on him. Suzie stays near the door. 

He is shocked to see her, thought she was dead, but was proud to know her. Sorry for his actions. 

Suzie cuts to the chase, and reads the Craigslist ad to him. 

McIntyre laughs at her assumption, "I never trained them. They trained me. Seriously... You losing your touch, Suzie?" 

Suzie thought McIntyre was self.trained, he says he used to PM someone on a forum, and they helped him out. Sou ds like that man. User name was jekyll82. 

Suzie thanks him, and frowns, "Are we going to need your help on this one?" 

McIntyre laughs, "Absolutely." 

She swears and leaves the room. 

*** 

Suzie and Quinn discuss findings and McIntyre. 

Identify jekyll82 as Edward Poole, an American working in Australia as a computer forensic expert, working for Google, but also for ASIO in an advisory role. 

Suzie laughs, deleted file was probably correct. 

Alarms begin blaring, prison is under attack. Unknown number of attackers. 

Suzie swears. 

*** 

Attackers burst through the door, incapacitate Suzie and Quinn. Kill McIntyre. 

Quinn disables both with a taser and the metalwork. 

Suzie passes out. 

# Chapter Six 

Suzie wakes up in prison hospital, Quinn on the phone next to her. 

She teases him, he flirts with her. 

Awkward silence. 

Quinn jumps in and says the new attack was professional, men hired through contacts. Person who knows a person who knows a person type thing. 

Suzie sits up in shock, "Works in forensics. Worked for ASIO. Knows McIntyre, and know professional killers? Shit… I know who it is." 

*** 

Suzie shows Quinn an old ASIO profile, Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Styles. 

The profile includes a date of death, 3 days after the incident with Josiah McIntyre. 

Quinn is surprised, but the profile includes information that states a previous history that would make sense. 

However, he is dubious because Styles is dead. 

Quinn receives a call, and immediately puts it on speaker. 

The United Humanitarian Front demands to speak with Susan Drakes, saying they will blow up a hospital if he doesn't comply immediately. 

Suzie answers. 

The UHF speaker states that they are a group who has followed her work closely, and assumed she would come out of hiding with the hacker situation. 

They offer to help, if she will lead them. 

Suzie gets pissed with their threat - they state that they are willing to do anything to achieve their goals. 

She is angry, but instructs them to track down Styles. 

*** 

Suzie begins digging in to the UHF, and determines that they are a hacker coalition, a global group of people loosely bound by a set of beliefs and common goals, but otherwise, entirely unnoticeable. This was the first time they had issued a violent threat. 

Quinn realizes the implications - they have a new leader, with less qualms and more motivation. 

One of the professional killers asks to speak to Drakes. 

*** 

The killer tells Drakes that the man behind the attack doesn't want her hurt, and is sorry so much pain has come so far - but what he does is for the good of everyone. 

Drakes scoffs. 

The killer asks if the UHF have contacted her yet. 

Drakes is surprised, and asks if his boss has used them for the event. 

The killer tells her that the threat to shut the internet down permanently is a ruse to make several global hacktivist groups come into the open, so they can be stopped. 

His boss considers the uhf to be the most dangerous. 

During the short downtime, the internet had been scanned, and the data was being analyzed. One thing they had determined was that McIntyre was a lieutenant for the new commander of UHF. 

They had also found encrypted packets everywhere, being used as a handshake signal, "Where is Arlia?" 

Suzie loses her temper, demanding how he knew the name. 

Quinn stops her - the man doesn't know anything. 

*** 

Suzie is arrested by ASIO. 

Quinn is taken into custody for questioning. 

*** 

# Chapter Seven 

ASIO Agent interrogates Suzie, eventually resorting to torture. 

The moment he does, a red alert sounds, saying an unknown pathogen had been detected. 

Agent panics, demands to know what she had done. 

Suzie shrugs it off, says she didn't do a thing. 

Door melts, and the two turn, Suzie says, "My stunt double on the other hand… She has a will of her own." 

Robotic version of Suzie walks into the room. 

*** 

Robot Suzie introduced as Nassu. Suzie and Nassu break Quinn out. 

They escape ASIO facility, and the panic sets in.  

UHF had Styles in a position of authority, had the capacity to disable world communications, knew something about Suzie's daughter, and an unknown agenda. 

*** 

Nassu supplied vehicle, and they head towards nearest populace. Small country town. 

Suzie takes apart café with wifi, and builds a larger system, hooking into the NBN. She then proceeds to break into the prison's security, reviewing the video. 

Identifies Styles. 

Finds his phone after hacking Telstra. 

Calls him. 

*** 

# Chapter Eight 

Styles is unsurprised that Suzie is calling. 

He then tells her where she is calling from, and how she broke out. 

Suzie demands to know about Arlia. 

Styles explains she is in a private hospital, and had been at the time of Suzie's capture. 

Suzie asks what he will do with her. 

Styles says, "I was a cop, not a monster. I'd give her to you if I could, but me and mine can't go up against the people who own that hospital." 

Suzie is confused, Styles explains that McIntyre was funded, John O'Connor was brainwashed, and the attack on Suzie and her family was organised by a single group, who are holding Arlia as a failsafe against Suzie. 

Styles is using the UHF to find and eliminate the group - difficult when the group could splinter and create new cells. 

Suzie is not entirely sure. 

Styles invites her to UHF headquarters in Melbourne. 

*** 

Quinn complains that Suzie is insane as they enter the apartment block. 

A guard places guns at the back of their heads, and Styles and Suzie disable the man and take the guns in sync. 

She walks up the stairs, and a man opens the door and casually waves them in. 

The two walk in and find a tech hub, computers and tvs everywhere, programmers and managers walking around, issuing orders, and hacking. 

Styles is by himself, nearby, and heavily disfigured. 

Suzie barely resists shooting him on the spot. 

The man invites them both to sit down, and explains how he faked his death to hide, but an anonymous group began hunting him down. They eventually caught him, copied his eyes and fingerprints into a computer system and used it to break into ASIO. 

He escaped and found the group was a coalition crowdfunding terrorists, and also allowing for trading of experts, intelligence, and goals. They made use of normal jobs, stocks, as well as money laundering operations. They were united not by belief, but by practicality. However, they still utilised the splinter cell model. 

Suzie asks if any individuals within this group had been id'd, and Styles rattles of a list of names, Suzie recognizing several, including the man who kidnapped her daughter. 

Quinn is skeptical, the NSA not knowing about the group. 

Styles laughs at him, saying that PRISM can only see what it gets told. Real Intel comes from monitoring people, not the world. (PRISM being a failure). 

Suzie asks how the analysis of the net was different, and Styles smiled, the snapshot they took was of the last sections of the Dark Net that collapsed, reinforced areas that weren't listed. 

They'd id'd twenty six agents so far. 

Quinn asked what the.group were calling themselves, still skeptical. 

Styles says, "They call themselves the Homegrown Front." 

Quinn goes deadly serious, saying NSA destroyed the group in the 80s. 

Suzie sighs, "Well, they're back." 

Styles asks Suzie if she can help locate and capture the group. 

Suzie considers it, and then refuses, stating that she just wants a normal life, and to be free of everything. 

Styles is slightly annoyed, and intensely disappointed, "You aren't the woman I remember." 

Suzie shrugged, "I've given enough. I gave my mind, and body, and lost my family and nearly my life. No more." 

Styles is aggravated, and says, "Then I guess you'll never get Arlia back." 

Suzie kills half a dozen people in the room and shoots Styles in both legs, yells, "Where is my daughter?" 

*** 

# Chapter Nine 

*** 

Styles is in incredible amounts of pain and flabbergasted by Suzie. 

Realizes that she is a woman with nothing left to lose, because she had already lost it. 

Styles explains that the UHF used "Where is Arlia?" as a call sign to try and get Suzie's attention. They don't know where she is, but they know that Arlia is alive, and in captivity, by the Homegrown Front. 

Suzie shoots him in the shoulder casually, asks to see any information they hold on her. 

Styles glares at her telling her that unless Suzie helps the UHF, she will never see Arlia again. 

Suzie kills Styles before Quinn can stop her. 

*** 

NSA agents are running all over the UHFs base, all the members in custody. 

Quinn yells at Suzie for destroying their best lead, shocked that she would kill someone in cold blood. 

Suzie basically ignores him, and then walks over to Styles body and rips the scarred part of his face off, revealing a USB drive. 

She hands the bloody USB to Quinn, smiles meanly, and says, "I'm done, Quinn. None of this is my problem. If ASIO come for me again... And I don't care if I kill them. If they assassinate me, so be it. I simply don't give a shit." 

Quinn orders her placed under arrest, but the agent that touches her is electrocuted. Suzie glares at him, and then walks away. 

*** 

In the street, Suzie meets her doppleganger, Nassu, and discusses what she has learned. 

Nassu found the private hospital where Arlis is being held, but believes it would take a team of fourteen or more to penetrate it. 

Suzie shrugs it off, and gets in a car as it arrives, the two are driven back to Suzie's place. 

*** 

Six ASIO agents are guarding the house, Suzie incapacitates, but doesn't kill them. 

She enters the house, says a random word phrase, and the floor slides apart, revealing two dozen like Nassu. Suzie smiles and speaks another random word phrase, and they become active. 

*** 

Suzie drops from personal drone onto hospital roof. 

Several guards warn her to back off, and that she would die. 

Suzie laughs, and the guards are sniped by Nassubots also flying around. 

Suzie enters the building, three forming up behind her. 

They massacre each guard they encounter, and take two doctors captive. 

Suzie breaks into a guarded room, finds Arlia sitting on the lap of a guard, playing with a gun. 

The man dares her to come closer. 

Suzie smiles, and says, "Arlia, what did mummy teach you?" 

Arlia glances over at her, "Protocol Twenty One?" 

The man dies from electrocution, Arlia drops the gun and waddles over to her mother and hugs her, "Bad men not so bad, mummy." 

Suzie smiles and picks her daughter up in a hug, "But?" 

Arlia grins, "Bad men still bad." 

Suzie leaves the hospital, protected by her private army. 

*** 

Quinn is waiting for Suzie at home, and he is unsurprised to see Arlia. 

He asks.to talk to Suzie in private, and Arlia goes with Nassubots inside. 

Quinn asks to know why Suzie killed Styles, and Suzie sighs, explains that she saw the USB underneath the scars. 

Quinn says that the USB held the virus that managed to bring the internet down. The NSA had devised an antivirus and it wax being disseminated globally. 

But the Homegrown Front was still an issue. 

Suzie shrugs, "Not my problem, Quinn." 

"Actually... It is. The Five Eyes has reformed, as informal as always, in the light of the UHF and the threat they posed. All agencies have agreed to pardon you and your crimes, if you assist in taking down the Front... Refuse, and we will eliminate you." 

Suzie is angry, and says that they should all leave her alone - it would be better for everyone. 

Quinn says he doesn't have that sort of power. 

Suzie rattles off a list of names and locations in Asia and Russia. 

Quinn is confused, Suzie says that it is a list of operatives in deep cover. She has more. If anybody made a move against her, the respective intelligence agencies would be informed, including each agent's exit strategy. 

Quinn says he will call it in, but he is disappointed in her. 

Suzie reminds him that she was dead - she came out of hiding to take down the UHF, and she did. 

*** 

Suzie playing with Arlia. 

*** 

# Chapter Ten 

*** 

Quinn is invited in by Suzie, served coffee on a table, and says that the Five Eyes had agreed to her terms and would leave her alone. 

She is pleased, apologises to Quinn about her behavior, but he understands. 

Says he reread her file, and is full of sympathy towards her. 

Suzie is given a written contract with her guarantee to freedom. She activates a touch computer inside the table and scans the document in, enabling it to be sent to every media outlet in the case of her death. 

Quinn is surprised by the computer, and asks if Suzie has anything lowtech in her house. 

She shrugs, "I got bored one weekend, so I made the table." 

Quinn stands to leave, thanking her for the drink, and Suzie says he can come round again, she doesn't care if he reports to the NSA on her. 

He's surprised, but says he might. 

He leaves, and Suzie opens a file on the table - identifying Quinn as a Homegrown Front member. 

*** 

Suzie deactivates all the Nassubots, but enables several small drones that protected her house. 

She does a small brain scan on Arlia, and is concerned with the results. 

The Homegrown Front had been manipulating her brain tissue and nerves, trying to enhance her already incredible ability to learn, hence Arlia's current development. 

Arlia is scared, saying that she wants to be normal. 

Suzie hugs her, feeling crushed and afraid. 

She shows Arlia her lab, full of spare parts and machinery, saying that it wad her only distraction from what she was. 

A with great intelligence comes great responsibility speech. 

Arlia builds a floating ball to bounce around. 

*** 

Suzie emails Quinn, letting him know that the Homegrown Front had altered the way Arlia thought. 

He arrived in person fifteen minutes later, Suzie gives him another coffee, whilst showing him the brain scans. 

Quinn passes out from something Suzie added to the coffee. 

She takes him downstairs into an interrogation chamber, and scans his brain, finding similar manipulation to Arlia. 

She questions him when he wakes up, using the brain scan as a lie detector. 

She then injects a chip onto the base of his spine, using it to override the changes caused by the Homegrown Front. 

Quinn nearly dies, but Suzie manages to seize a small fragment of data before saving him. 

She leaves him imprisoned, and begins to analyze and extrapolate the data, finding a phrase embedded into it. 

The strong live whilst the weak die. 

*** 

Suzie manages to reverse the process to Arlia. 

*** 

# Chapter Eleven 

*** 

Quinn wakes up, unrestrained, and finds Suzie watching him. 

He says he feels incredibly light headed. 

Suzie says she just reversed a chemical brainwashing that he had undergone, implanting him as a sleeper agent for the Homegrown Front inside the NSA. 

She shows him the brain scans and extracted data, and gives him an overview of how she reversed it. 

Says they had done the same to Arlia. 

Quinn laughs. "So that's why you left. Because I was an enemy?" 

Suzie agrees, and says she knows how to remove the brainwashing en masse, deactivating any unknown sleeper cell around the world, but she needs the UHFs internet virus. 

Quinn points out the virus is useless, and Suzie grins, saying she can work around that, and that she will be using it to broadcast on the internet, not disable it. She'll use it to turn every router, modem and satellite into a signal transmitter. 

Quinn reluctantly agrees, but has no idea how to get hold of the virus without any one knowing. 

Suzie hands him a USB, "Login, and then plug this in. I've been inside your system, remember?" 

Quinn agrees and leaves. 

Arlia begins crying in the distance. 

*** 

Suzie is sore and tired, watching Arlia sleep, when one of drones sets off a small alarm. 

Suzie brings up screens and is surprised to see Quinn trying to sneak in. 

She sets a drone to stun him, and another to drag him inside. 

*** 

Quinn wakes up, back in the brain scan chair. 

Suzie says that he had been brainwashed again. She has no idea how they did it so fast, her thinking it would take weeks to condition a person at the least. 

Quinn says that he was zapped by his phone and then passed out, right after he left that morning. 

Suzie is concerned - the Homegrown Front were watching her and hadn't bought her leaving. 

She reactivates the Nassubots and a myriad of drones. She then puts on a suit of armor, telling Quinn to stay put or her security system would.kill him. 

She leaves via the roof, heading towards the hospital where she found Arlia. 

Suzie finds ASIO agents in charge, who quickly surrender when they see her and her army. 

Suzie breaks into the computer, and finds as much data as she can. 

She finds the head ASIO agent and informs him that the Homegrown Front has a single united goal - an attack on a nuclear power plant in China. If aborted, they should be able to track down and capture the most influential members of the group. 

Agent points out that China is hardly going to listen to any information coming from ASIO. 

Suzie agrees, and then says that she knew a Chinese intelligence recruiter - a man who had repeatedly.tried to hire her through fairly anonymous means, but she had found the man. 

Agent agrees to prepare Aus for fallout. 

*** 

Suzie sits next to an Australian man at a bar, and placed a mahjong tile next to him, "I've got some information." 

The man stares at her, trying to act ignorant. 

Suzie ignores it and places a file on the table, "This one is a freebie. But, come near my daughter again, and the whole.of.China will get a little bit scared of me." 

She gets up to leave when the man catches her wrist, "How.did you find me?" 

Suzie laughed, "I've worked with ASIO, CSIS, and the NSA. Do you really think none of them ever suspected you of being an agent?" 

The man laughs, "Nice cover. So, how did you really?" 

Suzie shrugs, "Phones aren't that secure. Even if you parse it through Tor."
