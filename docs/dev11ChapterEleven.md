# Chapter Eleven

Quin rubbed his face, and then paused, glancing at his wrists.

He looked up and cringed, "You always stare at people, like that?"

Suzie shrugged.

Quin winced and touched his forehead, "I feel... Really lightheaded."

"I've reversed a chemical brainwashing technique that you've been through. You were implanted as a sleep agent for the Homegrown Front." Suzie shook her head, "They got to the Director of the NSA."

Quin sighed heavily, "I'll take your word for it."

Suzie grabbed a tablet and spun it around, "This is your brain. Here's where they messed with it. Its fairly simple, as far as complicated techniques go. They kind of made you susceptible to an outside signal. The most base emotion, rage, could be triggered and deactivated at will, and fairly quickly. Allows you to be influenced and controlled, in a fairly subtle way."

Quin winced, "Damn..."

Suzie winced, "They did the same to Arlia. Also played with her ability to learn."

He smiled, "So... That's why you left. Because I became one of the enemy."

"Yep." Suzie shrugged, "I... I've worked how to deactivate this brainwashing technique."

Quin rolled his eyes, "Yeah... I'd hope so."

"Not like that." Suzie ground her teeth together, "Worldwide. Everyone. Deactivate every sleeper agent they've embedded."

Quin blinked, "Cool... What do you need?"

"The virus that Styles made. The one that shuts down the internet."

Quin rolled his eyes, "We made that useless. Remember?"

Suzie grinned, "Easy-peasy. I'm not trying to take the internet down, I'm trying to use it to broadcast. I can turn every device into a deactivation transmitter."

He winced, "... Sure... But I have no idea how to get it for you. We locked that thing up tight."

Suzie handed him a USB, "Plug this into your workstation. I've been inside your system, I'll grab it."

"It won't be online."

Suzie nodded, "Sure enough, but electronic locks and cameras are in my way. I'll get the data, when you plug this in."

Quinn nodded and stood up, "Okay then."

As the door shut Suzie winced, hearing Arlia crying upstairs.
