# Prologue

The individual sat in front of a laptop, breathing slowly, and deeply. A small tangle of wires and green silicon chips lay nearby, a blue cable snaking into the laptop, but their eyes were focused elsewhere. 

They sat beneath a hood, eyes focused entirely onto a small dot at the top of the computer screen, a webcam. The resolution was terrible, the laptop itself was old, barely capable of what they were trying to achieve with it… But that was entirely the point. 

They smiled softly and tapped the enter key, and a command they had already typed began to run, and a series of beeps emitted from the device. 

They counted off the seconds in their head, as the world over, screens began to flicker, and be replaced with the low resolution feed from their webcam. 

Their hooded face went out across the globe - the TVs in pubs flickered, replacing football of all kinds with a black hooded figure. Giant stadium screens turned themselves on, and their face appeared there too. Amongst city squares screens flickered over, and everywhere people stopped and stared in surprise, wondering what the hell was going on. 

A deep male voice spoke, without electronic disguise, "I am just a man. I am nobody important. In fact, if I wasn't about to threaten all your lives and livelihoods, you should go ahead and ignore me." 

He leaned forward towards the screen, "But ignoring me would be a hell of a mistake… What I will do, will be seen by some… As terrorism. Others will see it as a religious crusade. They're both wrong. Some people will want to kill me, and many will try. In fact… I suspect that right now, this moment, orders and being shouted into phones, and people across the globe are trying to find me. Let me save you the effort - I don't exist, you can't find me." 

He shrugged, leaning back into the seat, revealing no backdrop, simply a blackness, "For the good of humanity, something must be done. To free us from oppression of our own making. Some people would deconstruct the government. Others would derail our power systems… Our water supply… I think, they're all right… So, for the good of humanity, I must break every level of government. So we can reinvent ourselves, rise from the ashes… I must destroy every resource we rely on… Now." 

He tapped the enter key a second time, and people flinched, waiting, and the figure laughed, "Check your phones." 

He cut the connection, and pulled out his own. 

Full signal, but no internet connection. 

It was the same across the globe. 

Of course though, this was just a warning. The internet would resume usual service, servers across the globe rebooting, terminals meant to never turn off would remain remarkably intact when they turned on again.  

The outage would only last twelve minutes. 

It was a warning. 

A message to prepare.
