# Chapter Ten

~~~

By the powers of her enemies,
glory is given unto her.

- Rising, anon.

Suzie opened the door slowly, and saw Quinn standing there, stiff faced and formal.

She smiled warmly and walked in, "Come in."

Quinn closed the door slowly, following her nervously.

Suzie sat down in her chair, another one across the coffee table from her, "Have a seat."

The Director of the NSA looked haggard, worn out, and absolutely exhausted. He sat down, and stared as Nassu appeared with coffee, before disappearing again.

"What is this?"

Suzie shrugged, "Some people refer to it as polite company. I prefer... To think of it as... Making ammends. Or starting to."

Quinn looked at her, "What?"

"I..." She winced and bit her lip, "I've been a bitch. Plain and simple. But..."

Quinn shook his head, "I get it, Drakes. I do. I've seen your file. I've seen what you've lost... And after spending these passed few days with you... I think I can start to actually understand. To have so much intelligence, so much... Genius... And yet, you've still been forced to lose so much..."

She winced, "Yeah."

Quinn shrugged, "Well, the parties involved finally agreed. You're out. They won't come for you. The threat did the trick."

He reached into his suit jacket and pulled out a document, placing it on the coffee table, "This is an agreement. You don't touch us, and we don't touch you."

Suzie tapped the coffee table beside the document and a blue square appeared around it, and she tapped a couple of icons, "This document, in it's entirety, will be sent to various news outlets in case of my demise."

Quinn laughed, looking at her, "Is anything in this house low-tech? A table actually a table?"

Suzie shrugged sheepishly, "I got bored one night. This kept me entertained for a few hours."

"You just built a massive computer in the shape of a table." Quinn shook his head, "You're a hell of a woman, Drakes."

He stood up slowly, "Thanks for the coffee, but I should be going."

Suzie nodded with a smile, "Come around sometime, maybe you can actually drink something."

He smiled, "Maybe I will."

After the front door closed Suzie sat down by the table again, and opened a file.

The document was simple, just a heauristic analysis on behaviour, for a person of interest.

It correlated what she'd been noticing.

Steven Quinn was compromised, he was an agent working for the Homegrown Front.
