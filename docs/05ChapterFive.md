# Chapter Five

Walking into the room was a nightmare. 

It was every waking dream, every fear brought to life, every trigger for every traumatic memory. 

He was almost the same, dark haired, intelligent beyond belief, and full of smiles. 

"Suzie!" 

Her heart flared, beating faster, and she couldn't stop the heat coming to her cheeks, and he smiled, "I'm flattered, you remember me." 

Her heart dropped and she glared at the main chained to the metal desk, hatred dripping in her voice, "How could I forget the man who tried to assassinate me, did kidnap me, and managed to cause an incredible amount of nerve damage to my ankle… It even required another exoskeleton design." 

Josiah smiled softly, "Which… You don't seem to need anymore." 

Suzie sighed heavily and sat down opposite him, "Nerves die. Repairing nerve damage is difficult at best… So I gave up trying to heal the nerves. I replaced them, when I was trying to hide." 

Josiah frowned, "I don't get the news in here." 

"I faked my death." She shrugged, "But… A certain hacker has turned up. He managed to hook into broadcast systems worldwide, and managed to shut the internet down temporarily, and is threatening to do it permanently." 

He stared at her, "Faked your death? Seriously? What happened?" 

She winced, tears welling in her eyes, "My husband was killed. My daughter, six months old, was tortured on live TV, and later killed… Because someone wanted to force my hand. Make me, make a weapon, for them." 

Josiah swallowed painfully, "Shit… I am so… Sorry." 

"I don't care what you think." Suzie said shaking her head, "I just need your help. The hacker, he looks like someone you trained. The code style he uses." 

Josiah nodded, showing an expression somewhere between a smile and a wince, "Sure… Got some code for me?" 

"No." She shook her head, "He posted an ad online, and hired a few… Killers. The ad was one sentence." 

Josiah nodded, "Yeah?" 

"Pay by credit card, service is for servicemen, or the like. Gang affiliations acceptable." Suzie said without hesitation and Josiah's eyes widened, "Wow. Uses my code, speaks in short utterances, expecting implications… Yeah, I remember them… Well, should be." 

Suzie raised an eyebrow, and he shrugged stiffly, "I don't know what to say… I didn't teach him to code. He taught me." 

She blinked, "Really? You were self-taught, as I remember." 

"I… I was… But…" Josiah bit his lip and then sighed, "I used to send messages to a guy on a forum. All I have is a user ID." 

Suzie nodded, "And it was?" 

"jekyll82." 

Suzie smiled, "Thanks. As enlightening as always… Are we going to need your help on this one?" 

Josiah grinned, "Absolutely." 

"Fuck." She muttered and stormed out of the room, slamming the foot-thick metal door.

Suzie raised an eyebrow, and Quinn shrugged, "I still have my own resources. They let me in… They just won't let me talk to McIntyre… Was he helpful?" 

Suzie shrugs, "Yes and no. We're looking for someone who prefers to go by jekyll82, with two 'L's, he taught McIntyre, not the other way." 

Quinn tapped his ear, "jekyll82, two 'L's. Check our files… Yeah… Aha… Sweet." 

Suzie raised an eyebrow, "And?" 

"He's on file." Quinn said with a grin, "Edward Poole. He's an American, a computer forensic expert, working for Google… He's now also consulting with ASIO." 

Suzie blinked, "Wow… He definitely will have found McIntyre by a deleted file." 

Quinn shrugged, "We've got the guy, how about we go get him?" 

Suzie shook her head, "He's been one step ahead the whole time… We're not going to get him that easily… In fact… I'm waiting for-" 

The alarm went off. 

A voice spoke over the loudspeaker, "Prepare for incoming. Unknown number of attackers… It’s a goddamn army out there people." 

Suzie winced, "Seriously? This guy is determined." 

Quinn shrugged, "Half a step ahead of him, this time." 

She rolled her eyes. 

*** 

Suzie tensed up, looking at the door carefully, "You ready for this, Quinn?" 

He rolled his eyes, "This is my day job, remember? Not yours." 

She laughed, "No... I wouldn't call this anybody's day job." 

The door evaporated, the steel turning to dust, and they burst through. Before Suzie could react two small metal pins hit her, over twenty thousand volts shooting through her body, causing the muscles to spasm uncontrollably, throwing her to the ground. 

The taser stopped shooting, and she gasped for air. 

The men ran through, kicking open the door. 

Josiah. 

She heard the shots, wincing as she forced her rattled body to its knees, barely upright when a boot met her face and she landed on her back, a gun aimed at her face. 

She was out of her depth here. 

The soldier collapsed backwards, shaking violently, and Suzie breathed a sigh of relief as she saw Quinn lying on his side, taser in hand. 

The other soldiers were gone, no chance to stop them. 

But at least they had one. 

With the relief, came the darkness, and she passed out.
