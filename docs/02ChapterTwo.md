# Chapter Two

Suzie's eyes widened and she grabbed her head, "Shit." 

She glanced up at the door that had slammed and the woman leaning on it, and she winced. 

The woman was wearing tracksuit pants, with signs that she'd been wearing them for at least a week, and she had a baggy pink hoodie over a loose top. She looked at Suzie, half with hatred, half with boredom. 

"Damn… I'm so sorry Anna… I didn't think that closing the JTA would hit you that hard." 

The woman rolled her eyes, "The Joint Terrorism Analysis taskforce got shut down. I had no job, how else would it hit me?" 

Suzie cringed, rubbing her face, "I thought the NSA would hire you." 

Anna blinked in surprise, "They did. I didn't want to do this anymore… How did you know they would try and hire me?" 

"Mathematical certainty." Suzie said with a shrug, and smiled, "It's good to finally meet you." 

Anna sighed and sat down across the desk, "So… This is about the hacker, yeah? I'm guessing you don't think they can catch him?" 

Suzie smiled, "But we can. I recognised the style. I know how he did what he did… Well… The TV part. Didn't really look into the internet thing, that's comparatively easy compared to broadcasting across the whole damn world." 

Anna nodded slowly, "So who is he?" 

"I don't really know, but I know the style. It's someone trained personally by Josiah McIntyre. You need to bring me to him, so I can show him the code the hacker used. He should recognise who it is." 

Anna's jaw dropped, "Josiah McIntyre is alive?" 

*** 

The same officer from before walked in, followed by two agents… Well, Suzie could tell they were agents by the way they held themselves, the way they walked. They weren't wearing suits or uniforms, they both wore a singlet and loose pants. 

She swallowed, "No way… I need to talk to Josiah McIntyre." 

"No fucking way." The officer growled, "I looked into him, after you mentioned him before. Seems he managed to… Seduce you… You aren't getting within six kilometers of the man." 

Suzie glared, "Without him, we aren't going to stop the attack that is coming." 

"It was just some kid." The officer shrugged, "But he failed. Now he'll be trying something new… And you are going to tell us everything you know about him." 

She gritted her teeth, "No, no I am not." 

The officer shrugged and walked out the door, "Your turn." 

The first one tried to grab her, and Suzie spun, landing an elbow to his throat, but then the sky went black and she felt the floor hit the side of her face. She looked up in surprise, saw the second standing over her. 

"Didn't your mum ever tell you not to hit girls?" 

Strong hands gripped her from behind and lifted her effortlessly, dropping her onto her back against the cold steel of the desk. 

A belt went across her throat, fastened down by electro magnets. 

Her wrists, ankles and waist quickly followed. 

She struggled to control her breathing, "Not again… Please…" 

The one in sight smiled, "Then tell us how the hacker did what he did." 

She rolled her eyes, "You wouldn't even begin to comprehend a tenth of it! And it won't help you find the hacker! You already know its someone as smart, if not smarter, than me… That narrows the suspects down… And you still want to torture me?" 

The man frowned, "You have a suspect. Who?" 

"Someone who trained with McIntyre. Was trained by him. The style is distinctive. It's a hex based system, that relies more heavily on syntax than on process." 

"What programming language?" 

Suzie shook her head, "Language doesn't matter. Style does. Any programmer can pick up most programming languages and get the gist of what it is saying. But we all have different ways we approach problems. Different things we prefer to do. For loops versus array iteration, for example." 

The man frowned, "I don't believe you. Who is behind this?" 

She gritted her teeth, "McIntyre knows, not me. He can't tell you who, unless he sees the code. I know how to write it." 

A piercing pain shot through her shoulder and she screamed. 

*** 

Suzie was dizzy, her eyes blurry, and she frowned as something bright pink crouched beside her, "Please… Suzie… Give them something." 

She laughed, "I gave… Them… Everything… They're just too… Stupid… To under… stand…" 

Anna winced, "If you just give them what they want, maybe they'll let you see McIntyre… Tell them how he hacked the TVs." 

"They won't understand." Suzie said and shook her head, "It's my one bargaining chip." 

Anna stroked her forehead, "Please… Suzie… I don't like watching this." 

"I didn't have to goddamn help!" Suzie screamed angrily, glaring at the blur next to her, "I was free. Free of all this fucking bullshit. I had my own life. I had friends, and a future. This could have been someone else's problem. I came to you. I was a goddamn hero! And now… Now I'm just some scumbag who needs to be tortured, so they'll confess." She shook her head and looked back at the light on the ceiling, "No thanks… Fuck 'em. I've given enough." 

*** 

Suzie felt the clamps release and she was placed into the seat, and then her wrists were clamped onto the table again. 

She blinked, looking at the officer through teary eyes, and he spoke carefully, "This is Steven Quinn. He's from the NSA." 

Suzie cocked her head, "NSA? You wouldn't have given any agent from the NSA access to me." 

The newcomer spoke, as he pushed the officer out the door, leaving the two of them alone, "I'm the Director." 

Suzie blinked in surprise, "Wow. An Intelligence Director talking to a retired and disgraced agent of another organisation… If this is a job offer, I have a job. I enjoy it." 

He laughed and sat down, "No… This is about how the hacker used a carrier wave and a microwave signal embedded in it to make aerial, cable and a few other vulnerable systems broadcast a much higher frequency, with some fancy decoding as well." 

She wiped her eyes on her shoulder looking at him, "Are you quoting one of your techs?" 

"Well, my techs found the data, but I understand it. Sort of a requirement these days. Especially after your last stunt." He smiled, "You worked it out faster though, didn't you? You sent an email to Anna Doherty saying you could help. You didn't do that thinking you could find him - you did it because you had already worked out how he did what he did. Right?" 

Suzie shrugged, "Yeah, sure… It wasn't that hard really." 

"It took my team seventeen hours to find the signal. Sort of gone by that stage. No way to track it to the source." Quinn scratched his chin, "Your fast, Drakes. I can use someone like you… And I have a deal for you." 

She glared, "I'm not sure my captors will agree with it." 

"They don't have a choice, they already have." He said and smiled, "If you promise not to run, to help us find the person or persons behind this, and avoid all physical confrontations… Your mine." 

She smiled, nodding slowly, "I like it… But me getting into a fight… That's inevitable. This guy will realise I'm on his trail, and try to blow us out of existence." 

Quinn shrugged, "Just say you'll try." 

She smiled, "Absolutely." 

He stood up, clapping his hands together, "Excellent." 

A guard walked in and detached her bindings, and Quinn glanced at her as she stood, "Didn't you need an exoskeleton to move your arm? And your ankle?" 

Drakes blushed, "I… I um… I fixed them." 

Quinn stared at her, "They were dead. Nerve, muscle and tissue damage." 

She nodded carefully, "Yeah, but people sort of recognise the exoskeleton gear I used… So I found a way to fix myself." 

He shrugged, "Sure. If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine."
